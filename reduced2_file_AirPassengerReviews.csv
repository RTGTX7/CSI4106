" London to Izmir via Istanbul. First time I'd flown TK. I found them very good in the air, cabin crew, planes, food, all very nice. Not so great on the ground, ground staff, call centre, computer systems. My flight from LHR was delayed so I missed the connection in Istanbul. Most ground staff don't speak English, and I was given contradictory instructions from those that could speak a little English. I eventually got on a flight to Izmir three hours later, but it wasn't an easy process, made worse by the vast distances one has to walk between gates in the cavernous new airport. Also, I'd phoned a TK call centre (based in Ukraine) to pay an extra Â£40 or so each way for extra leg room seats. However, as the departure times kept changing, my seats kept changing, and for the return leg to London from Istanbul I was not given an extra leg room seat. Luckily there was a spare exit row seat and the cabin crew sorted me out. Overall, I think their cabin crew and planes are very good, ground staff and call centre staff need better training and they all need better computer systems and software to work with.",Passive
" Istanbul to Bucharest. We make our check in in the airport, they Take our luggage , we go to the gate and at the gate surprise they dont let uÈ™ board with two children, because they say the flight is overbooked. We had to wait in the airport with two children until 5 oclock in the morning until they bring uÈ™ to a hotel 2 hours far away from the airport without luggage, without eat without nothing. Our first and last flight with this airline.",Detractor
" Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul. I flew with this company several times in the past years, and I can honestly say that it is getting worse and worse. I flew from Rome to Prishtina via Istanbul, all 4 flights had a delay (which apparently is pretty normal with Turkish). The ground staff is for the most part useless. In Istambul i have tried to ask a few information about a flight delay (i had just 30 minutes before the connecting flight) and the whole answer was: ""Relax Sir, No problem Sir, It's okay"". The new airport is a gigantic mess, very big and disorganized. When you land in Istanbul it takes about 20 to 25 minutes taxiing and other 10 minutes before they actually start disembarking, it's an exhausting experience especially if you are in a hurry. Forget about asking for some indication at the new airport, they all chat between each other, some with a coffee in their hands. I flew with four different aircraft on this trip, two were fairly new, the other two were old, seats worn. Food on board was of very poor quality.., let me repeat this, very...poor quality. In general i can say that crew is decently trained and deliver a good experience or at least they try, of course it is far from the experience you get flying Qatar or Emirates but still pretty good, while ground personnel, especially in Istanbul is the personification of the word Lazy. A complete disaster. I will try and avoid Turkish Airlines in the future, it is not a cheap company and definitely not worth for the money you pay. If you are in a hurry or you know you will be avoid this company and avoid the new istanbul airport at all costs.",Detractor
" Flew on Turkish Airlines IAD-IST-KHI and return KHI-IST-IAD. Turkish Airlines has consistently maintained its quality since I first flew with them in 2007. The flights leave on time, the catering is excellent, the inflight entertainment is extensive and the interface easy to use, and the cabin crew is excellent. Interesting though the A330 on the KHI-IST route and return seemed to have more leg room and was newer than the A330 on the IAD-IST route which was showing its age. The A330 on the IAD-IST route had a slow responding interface for the inflight entertainment and a broken table on the return flight. But Turkish Airlines will be replacing the A330 on its flight to IAD with the 787 sometime in the summer. Turkish food was served on the return leg which I personally like, and I saw the cabin staff helping elderly passengers walk to the lavatory which was nice. Overall another wonderful experience with Turkish Airlines.",Promoter
" Mumbai to Dublin via Istanbul. Never book Turkish airlines if you are traveling to Dublin from Mumbai. If the flight gets delay from Mumbai, they don't have any other options for you. They will straight forward ask you to stay in hotel in Istanbul. They do not care for any for your time loss. No decisions has been made from airlines crew within time. They kept me waiting for more than 3 hours.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Budapest via Dublin with Turkish Airlines. Delays on each flight for both legs of the journey - stuck in Istanbul for almost 20 hours with ground staff who were rude, slow or unhelpful and took an hour to get our bags. The only only thing positive I can say is that the food on the plane is good, everything else was disastrous.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Algiers, planned to take off at 9:30 pm and to arrive to Algiers at 11:20 pm same night. We got an announcement that the flight is delayed by 2:55 hours due to technical issue. Then after boarding around midnight, and after starting taxiing, the pilot announced that the issue is still there and we have to go back to the gate! Another delay announced! Furthermore, they did not allow the passengers to get off the plane! complete chaos since the passengers do not want to take this aircraft anymore (and I completely understand) and what worsen the situation is that neither the pilot nor any official came to us and explained what is going on. No explanation, no apology, nothing! they requested the police and we saw armed civilian men at the gate . We did not take off until 6:30 am (that's a total delay of more than 9 hours!) Due to this delay, I lost my full working day in Algiers on April 15 due to the resulting inconvenience and fatigue (I am a consultant and I had several meeting planned for that day). I will never take Turkish Airlines again.",Detractor
" Basel to Cape Town via Istanbul. When I arrived in Istanbul at 10pm we are informed that TK44 to Cape Town (departure at 1.55am) is delayed 4,5 hours. No reason for this Delay was announced. I received a voucher for Burger King, Sbarro Pizza or Popeys. The staff at the gate were very unfriendly.",Detractor
"  Abu Dhabi to Luxembourg via Istanbul. From AUH-IST, as the flight was at 1:30am, the flight was I comfortable due to the small size of the aircraft. The seats were cramped although the leg room was okay-ish. Service started mid way through and the food was okay but nothing great. Staff was mostly friendly. IST-LUX staff was friendlier, aircraft was bit better, the food was of the same standard though. I think it was a decent experience overall but I would prefer a more spacious air craft even if the flight is 4.5 hours from AUH.",Passive
" The experience with Turkish Airlines has been devastating one. First paid $200 Euros per luggage, totaling $400 Euros for 2 luggage that end up lost between Turkish Airlines and JetBlue. My itinerary was from Venice to Istanbul to Boston and from there with Jetblue to San Juan, Puerto Rico. Once I made it to Boston I looked for my luggage and it never made it to BOS. I immediately try to make a reclamation to Turkish Airlines at BOS and was told that I had to wait until my final destination. Once I made it to my final destination I made my claim. Turkish Airlines will not cooperate with Jetblue and even if JB was really trying to help is not much they could do because TATurkish Airlines did not care for my luggage. It never made to Boston. Turkish Airlines have been unhelpful. In my case, even presenting evidence to both airlines, neither is able to find my lost claim luggage. It seems the claim is a form which after being submitted it get to be submitted evidence, dead word, as they do not even comply with the search of the lost not delivered luggage in hands of Turkish Airlines.",Detractor
"  New York to Erbil via Istanbul. They have the worst customer service. My initial leg was delayed due to weather so I was going to miss my connection. Turkish Airlines did nothing to help - in fact finding someone with Turkish Airlines to assist is a feat in itself. TA kept passing the blame. Bottom line - if any segment of your Turkish Airlines flights causes a delay then you are SOL when it comes to TA. Plan on spending a lot more money and flying another airline because Turkish Airlines will not assist you and they will keep your money. The ""customer service"" is a joke - they read from scripts and keep repeating the same paragraph - almost like robots. They also tell you to send an email - it is just a stalling tactic.",Detractor
" Tehran to New York via Istanbul. Terrible experience and terrible customer service! Will never fly again. I tried to change my flight date, called the airline and they made the changes. Told me I would be getting a confirmation email after I hang up (Never received it). I called back, submitted my request again and was told that someone would get back to me in at most 7 days (Never happened again). I called back (this was 3 days to the actual flight date), was told I need to go to a Airline office to make a change!. The closest office to me is 250 miles away. Also, there was a schedule change on the ticket that I did not confirm. When I called, I was told that I would not get charged the penalty, I ended up getting charged+the fare difference (almost 500$). In addition to the trip cost (200$) for a one way trip. So this has never happened before with any other airline. It would have been easier to cancel and buy a new flight which would have cost me around $800 for a two way.",Detractor
" Belgrade to Athens via Istanbul. My first flight departed with delay from Belgrade due to local weather conditions in Istanbul. I requested for a connection assistance in order to catch my second flight but the airline did not provide me such assistance. I managed to arrive at the gate of departure of my second flight while boarding was not completed and while the screen mentioned 'last call' but I was denied boarding because 'the system had unchecked me from the second flight due to late arrival of my previous plane'. People were boarding in front of my eyes on the plane. The Turkish Airlines officer deceivingly told me to go to another gate (215) because another plane was waiting for me. He just got rid of me. Gate 215 was near the rebooking office of Turkish Airlines for the issuance of new tickets. Although I was condemned to stay overnight at the airport, I was not proposed hotel accommodation or a meal. I was put on another flight departing next morning without even offered the possibility to select my checked seat (the officer rejected my request for an aisle position despite the fact that the plane was half-empty!). I filled a complaint form for denial of boarding and they replied that they are not responsible for a flight delay due to weather conditions. Turkish Airlines maybe is a large company but it manages these type of routine problems poorly as a low budget airline.",Detractor
" Dublin to Tel Aviv via Ä°stanbul. First of all our flight was delayed for over an hour, but that's fine we crossed that bridge, then when we arrived in Ä°stanbul airport we were told that we missed our connection flight. Ridiculous considering the fact the tickets were bought from Turkish Airlines and not from different companies, ok, 10 minutes of talking to customer service and we got new tickets from Ä°stanbul to Tel Aviv (not same comfortable plane as it supposed to be but still something) Arriving in Tel Aviv we found our 3 bags on the belt but so called oversized bag (which was actually a doll birthday box for my daughter) was missing almost 2 hours waiting for it to be found (no luck) then another half an hour of registering with lost&found made us exhausted (myself my husband and 2 kids aged 3 and 5 at 5am in the morning is no fun at all) We supposed to pick up our rental car in between 3-4am and when we came to get it apparently the car was gone to another customer because we were late. We had no choice but get another more expensive car that was available (I think Turkish airlines should be liable for that as well) We registered lost baggage gave the address and phone number in Petah and asked them to deliver it there as we were going to Eilat for a few days. I was pretty much confident that should be no problem with contact details. I was 5 days later arriving back to Tel Aviv and with no contact from lost&found I rang them to see what's the story and I was shocked when I heard that my baggage was delivered to me the following day! Where? When? To who? The answer was simple we have in our system that you baggage left to Eilat next day and was delivered to the hotel so we are really sorry but you have to get it yourself from there! How come they left my baggage in the hotel without notifying me? Answer was: Delivery company rang you but there was no answer. Left a message? I doubt it I think it's pure lies) Anyway I said I want my baggage back please get it to me! Oh you know it might take couple of days. Fine I said just get it please! Few days later I rang again because nothing came and find out that delivery man came to the hotel in Eilat asked for me but because me and my spouse have different surnames he was told that there's no such person registered (but then the question is how could he leave it there if he was told the person is not there) Again I was promised that few days later I will get it. As you can imagine I didn't. Rang again today asked for the manager (was told the manager is in holiday) got to speak to supervisor and what a surprise she said that the baggage is not in the hotel in Eilat but in airport Eilat and because it's holiday (Pesah) the airport is closed and they can't get it. And she said you know it's your fault that it went to Eilat. When I asked her name she refused to give and hanged up on me.",Detractor
" Houston to Kiev via Istanbul. Fares seem competitive, but there is a catch in terms of layover time. Mine from Houston to Kiev Via Istanbul had a return leg layover of 14 hours and though TK website says that a layover of over a certain hours gets a complimentary hotel stay. But there is a fine print somewhere which they always get a disqualified citing some wired â€œrulesâ€ that I, even as a frequent traveler cannot comprehend. Another notable difference in Turkey is that there are endless and multiple security checks, and one wonders if one is going through a war zone . Lines at security checks and passport control ( yes, if you need to stay at a hotel for a long layover, one needs to get an e-VISA just to get out, check into a hotel and get back to airport to catch the connecting flight). Ended up paying way more than if I had chosen other airlines like LH or SAS, which I will keep in mind next time",Detractor
" Tashkent to Istanbul. A poor experience with Turkish Airlines. The guy who seemed to be the cabin chief was acting in a very extremely rude way towards the passengers, almost yelling at them, mostly hurrying people to sit down quickly. Very unprofessional. The tightest space for seating I experienced, apart from a low cost carrier in Indonesia. A mess with luggage, clearly too many volumes allowed onboard.",Detractor

 Nakhchivan to Istanbul. The flight set off a little bit late and boarding was disorderly with too many passengers carrying oversized baggage on board.

 London Heathrow to Istanbul. The flight from LHR took off on time. Boarding was hassle free. Seating was 3x3x3. Legroom was average but I had an emergency exit row seat. Cabin service was average with not many smiles. The flight was smooth as was the landing.,Passive
 Istanbul to Trabzon. Boarding was fast. I thought flight will be on time but no! Taxi took forever. We've waited 40 minutes to take-off. Don't remember if I've heard any explanation from cabin crew. I'd prefer 60 minutes at airport to 40 minutes at a plane seat. Cabin crew was good. Sandwich and drink giveaway was nice. Cheap price.,Passive
" Izmir to Istanbul. It was my first Boeing 777 experience. They gave a free hot sandwich with cheese and vegetables and a drink. Hot and cold options were rich. Cold ones weren't very cold but you can add some ice to them. Plane was really big and crowded yet there were no problem with fresh air and air conditioning. Well, maybe one. One of the cabins leaked some water to a passenger. They suddenly suggested he change his seat, he refused. Flight on time, good cabin crew. And this time, it was extremely cheap.",Promoter
 New Delhi to Cappadocia via Istanbul. I took a flight from New Delhi 6:15pm on 16th April it got delayed by 1.5hours and flew at 7:50pm. I had a connecting flight at 12:20pm on 16th April to Cappadocia from Istanbul but as I reached late due to delay from this airline I missed my flight. They gave me a flight for 11:30 pm without providing any hotel accommodations. Later I had to force them to give me a earlier flight as I was tired so they gave me a flight for 8:35pm TK 2018 which also was delayed and the flight departed at 10:50pm. I some how was happy that at least I reached Cappadocia but my whole day and hotel booking was wasted. I went to pick my luggage but as to my surprise my luggage did not arrive and I was told it's arriving in the next flight and they shall have it sent to my hotel. I came to my hotel and not it's about 4pm on 17th April and my luggage has still not arrived even after making several calls. This airline has charged me a lot without giving any good service or facility. I would highly recommend not to book Turkish Airlines ever to any one unless they want to waste their time and money. Don't know when will my luggage arrive and till when I have to sit in my hotel and waste time as I cannot freshen up unless I get my clothes and got out to see this city.,Detractor
"  Singapore to Zagreb via Istanbul. Customer service at Istanbul Airport is horrible. I miss my connecting flight upon arriving in Istanbul from Singapore. I have ask the flight attendants onboard regarding my connecting flight. She assure me that I have no problem doing the connection. Upon arrival, there was no staff to assist. My flight was not showing on the display. I end up going to their care point counter. The staff there is the worst. I would give the rating negative 1. They just took their time to figure out your next flight. If I have not insisted that I need to fly on the same day, they just put me on the next day flight. This is the worst terminal service I come across in my 10 years of travel.",Detractor
" Baku to Amsterdam via Istanbul. They still operate like a third world airline. Check in counter staff at the new airport was ignorant (when she finished my check in, she just left the boarding pass and my passport on the counter instead of handing them to me).

"  New York JFK to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. Do not fly Turkish Airlines! We had round trip scheduled March-April 2019. Just before leaving on our trip they cancelled the second leg of our return flight and placed us on another flight which involved a 14 hour layover in Istanbul airport. Then, upon arrival in Istanbul on our way out to Tel Aviv they cancelled the second leg of this part of the trip as we stood at the gate waiting for departure and put us on another flight several hours later because the later flight was not full. Imagine 300 People at an airline gate waiting as staff filled out new boarding passes for everyone by hand!. We cancelled our return arrangements (without refund) and flew another airline home at the end of our vacation. Rather lose the money then deal with this airline any further!",Detractor
" Kathmandu to Berlin via Istanbul. Their service is worst because they usually overbook the flight and it was like first come first serve basis and airport staff don't even listen the customer request. They treat people like they are doing favor to them. Flight often delayed by 2- 4 hours and they don't care about your connecting flight. In my return flight after issuing boarding pass, my seat plan was changed without any notice and in flight entertainment system is damaged and it was 9 hours long flight.

I called the customer service almost ten times in the last 2 days and it is never answered. In their online luggage tracing system, they don't even update what they did or how long I need to wait. I doubt that I would ever book Turkish Airline again. As a frequent flier of the long-haul flights, I have never experienced lost luggage. I know that it is not uncommon that luggage can be delayed or missing. But what is lacking is their customer service.",Detractor

" Atlanta to Amman via Istanbul. Beside being one of the filthiest airport bathrooms and cheap of course for not making it easy to use the Wi-Fi, they make us wait 5 more hours in the transit just because they can fill up the plane by merging another plane for people who are going to Amman without giving us any notice!

I had a very long layover both the ways around (20hrs) each. I had heard from many friends that Turkish would give a hotel or other relevant services if we have to wait there above specific hours.

To my surprise, the lady on the desk took my all information from passport and ticket and said you cannot get a hotel. Then I asked why",Detractor
"  Mumbai to Istanbul. One of the worst experiences of our life has been this trip on Turkish Airlines. After booking a confirmed flight on 6th April we were offered one in which the connecting flight leaves 2 days earlier than we land. Thankfully we didn't select this by mistake. Then we were given a new itinerary which needed us staying overnight at Istanbul. We were then given a hotel room outside the airport which needed us to spend 220 USD on an express visa to enter Turkey plus an additional 100 USD on travel. The airline doesn't give you rooms in the airport, which turns out to be more expensive for the passenger as there is no proper public transport to our hotel room and Turkish won't pay for it. To make matters worse today the check in doesn't work and they've told us we need to reach early to the airport if we need good seats. Avoid this airline for its terrible customer service.",Detractor

" Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. I wont book again after the conditions I flew in. Food: tasty. Over the average for an airline. In-flight entertainment: large variety of movies. Cabin crew: negligent and sloppy, to a frustrating level. So many episodes where they disregarded very simple requests from passengers or (worse) caused problems due to their disorganization. Gate crew: at the check-in I chose a spot that would allow me to easily access the bathroom, that I need for medical reasons. At the gate the seat got striked through and I have been re-assigned, no explanations provided. When I asked for the seat to be changed to an aisle seat, I have been told by the cabin crew to temporarily sit on the assigned seat. After take-off, my request got ignored for the whole flight, regardless many seats were empty. Seats extremely unconfortable and impossible to sleep in (very old plane for a 10h flight). Mine was even broken so I could not sleep at all. Food service: chaotic to the point that some people started to serve themselves due to the fact that their requests were disregarded or forgotten. Overall a very bad experience that leaves me confused at how this company won any awards. At first I also gave it the benefit of the doubt that's why I waited to write the review but the return flight confirmed all the negligent behaviors I saw on the departure flight. Other airlines offer very similar prices and the cons don't make up for the flight conditions you will experience.",Detractor
" Venice to Ankara via Istanbul. Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn't leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: ""Wait a minute"".. I didn't want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.""The flight is full!"". And it is still not the end of the troubles, instead of being delayed 40 minutes the ""great"" TA let me wait one hour longer in comparison with original departure schedule. The service was the mess and the behaviour of the employees was everything but not professional.",Detractor

The drinks trolley service came by and the same FA who told me â€˜off' remembered what drinks I had asked and served me. Such a hassle to get a drink because I asked for it out of their sequence.

" Flew TK 5 / 22 MAR, Istanbul - Chicago in business class. Had requested AVML (Asian vegetarian Meal). TK had forgotten my special AVML meal. On board they served boiled eggplant, tomato sauce and disgusting rice as THE main course. I refused to eat and returned my plate. No alternative food offered. I spoke to the cabin chief who expressed she was sorry and agreed that the meal served was not even close to AVML. Spoke to the chef on board who had no clue what AVML looks like. Starved for 12 hour flight. Cabin chief and the chef promised they would report this incident but it seems it did not go anywhere. I am an Elite Plus member of Turkish Airlines and it seems they do not care about their premium cabin passengers. Surprisingly cabin chief is TK's employee and the chef are employed by DO & CO catering company who provided meals for TK's passengers. Complained about the incident and response I got was we regret and no compensations given. It will be hard to choose TK for future travel.",Detractor
" I bought and paid tickets 3 months before departure. I had pre-selected certain seats convenient to us. I am a self-moving disabled person. I have no leg, I move on a prosthesis. The choice of a comfortable place is important for my sick leg. When I flying from Hurghada â€“ at the reception manager not given our pre-selected seats. He give to me uncomfortable seats in the tail of the aircraft, although I chose a seats for 4 months before departure. Turkish Airlines does not have Internet check-in when passengers departing from Hurghada. At the check-in Desk, the Manager issues boarding passes at random, not paying attention to the pre-selected seats in our tickets. 2. Indifference flight attendants In the plane, I ask for 2 flight attendants and explained the essence of the problem, said about my disability, showed my ticket. The flight attendants answered me: â€œThe plane is full. I can't help you, sorryâ€ The flight attendants were absolutely indifferent to my problems, they did not want to help me. 3. Stuff indifference at Ataturk Airport. Upon arrival in Istanbul, I had a connection time at the airport: 3: 20 - with our next flight to Vnukovo, Moscow. I was very tired, I had a pain in my leg, and I turned to the Info desk to ask the managers to let me rest for a short time in the lounges of Turkish Airlines. I said that I was disabled, I asked for help. In response, I received complete indifference, unwillingness to help me. The manager refused me any help, despite my repeated requests for help. I have not seen anywhere such a bad attitude, indifference to the disabled person in my air travels! 3. Problem with pre-ordered special meals When I buying tickets, my wife and I ordered Bland meal (BLML) and Diabetic meal (DBML) We always order in flights these types of food for our medical reasons. In all the airlines that we flew this food is much better than the standard meal. But in the case of Turkish Airlines, our special meal was simply inedible. This special meal given to us looked much worse than the standard nutrition. We just could not eat anything and flew hungry all our flights â€“ in two ways! I remember that in my meal there was a lot of fiber, which I cannot eat. This is incompatible with the concept of the Bland meal (BLML) diet.",Detractor
 Amsterdam to Bangkok via Istanbul. Flight boarded four hours late with no communication during this delay. Boarding was a complete shambles with everybody scrambling to get on. Once boarded the business class crew looked completely uninterested which continued throughout the flight.

Water for an almost 13 hour flight is essential, but was never offered.",Passive
" Dhaka to Copenhagen via Istanbul. This trip was full of disappointments. Already the airport lounge, Dhaka, demanded money for a glass of wine, unheard. I am a frequent flyer, I have never experienced business class lounge charging a business class passenger, for a glass of wine. Next, on board, no welcome drinks. I asked for a newspaper and a drink, the choice was a glass of water or a lemonade. After take-off, no beverage and snacks, just the meal, which was disgusting. My choice was beef, which was cold, dry, served with some bean and carrots, also cold. I asked for a glass of red wine, but waiting and waiting, I tried to draw the attention of a crew, who was talking with another passenger in the front row. Then I had to get up went where he was enjoying a conversation with the passenger. I made my request- I got served a glass of wine-. I expressed my gratitude- and the crew explained the delay- he had to take care of a CIP. The meal was eatabel, so asked for a cup of coffee and a glass of cognac. Surprise- the crew said there was no cognac. I showed the menu, which showed cognac was available. Well, had almost 6hours layover at Istanbul airport lounge, which was OK. About 90 minutes prior to board, we were asked to go the the gate. After completion of checking tickets and passports, we were waiting to board- almost 45 minutes had to wait and then bus to the plain. The flight was on way to Copenhagen. There were a grpoup of Danish passengers,. A elderly gentleman asked for lass of cognac, the crew was about to serve a generous glass of cognac. Another female crew rushed and snatched the glass, poured half of the content to another glass and then served the guest. We had a laugh- that was entertaining.- but not convincing for making Turkish Airline the choice any more.",Detractor
" Hanoi to Milano via Istanbul. As we 4 arrived this morning from Hanoi at 6 am (TK168) we learned that our connecting flight to Milan TK1873 had been cancelled. No assistance was given to passengers, everybody had to wander around the immense airport, address the numerous TK people behind desks each of whom seemed to take care of anything but customer service and only care to dispatch people somewhere else. Finally we got to the right desk and were given the TK flight leaving at 16.15, 10 hours waiting time. We were assured this was the first possibility open. To our surprise we discovered that there is a previous flight leaving at 12.45 with seats available. Hundreds of people crowded at the desk with only 2 employees working so we gave up trying to anticipate our flight, and no contact was possible on the phone.",Detractor
 Manila to Vienna via Istanbul. Seats are comfortable. In-flight media selection is great and updated. Food is good. Paid in-flight Wifi (MNL-IST) is excellent for long-haul flights. No Wifi for IST-VIE. Cabin crew not friendly but not bad either. Boarding can be quite delayed. Gate announcements are delayed (sometimes changed at the last minute) - be careful! You might miss your flight especially if you have a hard time finding gates.,Promoter
"  Boarding totally chaotic and far too long. Nice meal, creepy safety video which distracted the people more than giving them advice. Crew notifications (strong turkish accent, sound quality) hardly understandable, even for native speakers. Economy legroom and seat width did not at all suit the flight duration on the first flight from Phuket to Istanbul (11 hours), more equal to short-distance low costers. (disclaimer: I had a seat at an emergency exit, luckily). WiFi did not work for me and others at all, for some more expensive devices it did, but very slowly (asked my neighbours and staff for help, but no way to get it working). Very expensive seat pre-selection (160+30â‚¬ for a 400â‚¬ flight), so I did not take it and was lucky at the airport check-in.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Amsterdam. Although a bit worn and older than A330-300, the economy cabin of A330-200 is more comfortable than 333's. This flight had a good seat pitch for a short haul flight. Ground service was smooth and cabin crew was one of the best I have seen at Turkish. Since the second choice of meal was out, we were offered more complimentary drinks.

After a few years of slight disappointments, I am happy to include Turkish Airlines into my highly preferred airlines once again.",Promoter
" Ankara to Istanbul. Although there was no IFE in this version of 737-800, it is a flight that takes less than an hour. Seat pitch and comfort was probably best I have seen in a 737-800. A delicious short-haul panini and drinks deserve the points.",Promoter
" If you fly economy with an A330-300 of Turkish Airlines, be prepared for a problematic seat pitch. I just could not became friends with the seatings of the majority of wide-body planes of Turkish. Other than that, this was a pleasant flight. Ground service was smooth and friendly - this was a good surprise. Cabin crew may use a little more smiles on their faces but did not experience any major problem on that side. IFE selection and quality is vigorous, one of the best you can encounter anywhere. Meal and drinks are good as always - an above average Chardonnay was a joyful accompany. Thumbs up.",Promoter

 This was my first time using Turkish Airlines and I was satisfied. Check in at Lyon airport was fine. The flight was full but I managed to find space for my carry on bags. The flight left a bit late. The cabin on board was in good condition and seem to be new. The crew and the service was good. The inflight entertaiment is excellent with a big screen for each sea and a great selection of different type of movies. The meal was tasty and there was a good selection of any type of drinks. The flight went fine but it took more time to land in Ataturk airport because of weather in Istanbul. Turkish airlines is an excellent airline and operates probably to the most countries in the world. I would defently fly again with them if I have a chance,Promoter
" Dublin to Manila via Istanbul. This flight was both a disaster and a nightmare. This incident happened during Istanbul-Manila leg of my flight. Im not sure what happened, but I your ground crew was disorderly and very unwelcoming. The boarding was horrible, flying business is not worth it especially I am queueing with the rest of the passengers. The on board experience was the tipping point. Since last year, I never had problem with my Vegan meal onboard as I make sure to preselect them online. But this flight was a disaster. Not only I made only preselection, I wrote to the menu that I am vegan, and the chef was aware i dont eat cheese as he asked me before flight. When I was served with appetizers, I was curious as they gave me a butter on a small dish. At first, I though it could be vegan as I was given butter previously, but that was on a pack, not this time. I called the head steward and explain my conundrum. The chef came and explained and apologized. They insisted i ordered vegetarian as shown on their records, but I showed my confirmation email that I did preselect Vegan meal. Somewhere something went wrong. I settled for orange juice, and went to sleep. Before landing, the chef gave me a minimal but unbusiness like food. I still appreciate his effort to come up with vegan food.",Detractor

I was traveling for a conference and unfortunately missed a connection flight after last minute gate change. I was sent around their customer desks without any help. I was finally told I needed to pay extra to change my ticket, an amount that was far more than the original cost of the return ticket. They said the best they could do was to help me call my family. I was left stranded at Istanbul Airport. I had to request a friend to pay for a ticket from a different airline to get to my conference destination. After the conference I went back to the airport hoping to utilize my return ticket with Turkish Airlines, only to be told that it is no invalid and I have to book a flight afresh. I struggled to raise money and finally was able to buy a ticket with different flight and go home.",Detractor
" I along with my 6.5-month-old son were traveling from London to Kabul via Istanbul. The flight from London got delayed. When I arrived at Istanbul I couldn't find my son's pushchair which was supposed to be next to the aircraft. I had to jump on the bus to get to the next flight but when I arrived that was gone. I was only booked on the next flight leaving 24 hours later. I was not offered any accommodation or any facilities to help me care for my baby. Even the pushchair was not brought to me so at least the little one could sleep. In the past when I had traveled with them with my husband for much shorter stays we would be offered free food and drinks but didn't receive that as well. Because I was a woman with a small child and couldn't argue with them because my son was crying all the time, they just made sure I don't get any help, while I should have been offered more given the circumstances. In light of all this, my son and I suffered very much and it wasn't even our fault. Please avoid this airline they are the worst people to fly with. They pick on people who are more vulnerable and in need. I will never ever fly with this airline again. My problem is not with the delays, delays are part of traveling but when the airline gets it wrong they should have the moral standards to look after their customers especially when its a mother and a child. They should have the mindset as to how to do more, but as I explained above their attitude was how to give less and cheat a mother and a little child.",Detractor

" I was supposed to fly from Dubai to Atltanta via Istanbul - all on Turkish airlines. The flight from Dubai was delayed by an hour before it even took off.

" Never again will I use Turkish Airlines. We booked the ticket to Cape Town from Malaga (via Istanbul) 6 months in advance and chose Turkish due to the more direct route than having to travel to UK/Northern Europe or Middle East. We paid for extra legroom seats on all flights. One hour before leaving for the airport on our outbound date I received a phone call from the Turkish Airlines ticket desk at Malaga Airport to advise that the Istanbul-Malaga (second leg) of our return journey flight had been cancelled. They told us to go to the ticket desk when we arrived and before we checked in to be given options. The options were an 8 hour wait in Istanbul airport for the next flight (no thank you after an 11 hour flight) or the same flights a day later. We opted for the second option of flying on our original flight choices day later. The lady on the desk suggested that we claim afterwards for the extra hotel night and the extra day car hire. She also said that she could not book us the seats we had already paid for and that we should try to ticket desk in cape Town to do this for us. We checked in, we started to board, they got us all on to the air bridge where we stayed for about an hour before being moved back into the terminal. Then we boarded. The flight departed 90 minutes late with no explanation. The staff said that they did not know what the problem was. We arrived in Istanbul with a short connection due to the delay and after being bussed from the plane to the terminal we ran like crazy to get on the flight. We made it but our luggage remained in Istanbul. One case arrived a day later & the second case 2 days later. We collected the first case ourselves (as we thought they were both there) and went to the ticket desk to arrange the seats for the return journey. We had to leave all of our details with them as they were busy and unable to attend to it at the time. I e:mailed the ticket desk and customer services a number of times and each time the mails were returned with a message saying that the inboxes were full and could not accept any further mails. I also made a few phone calls but never managed to get an answer. After about a week I received a call from the ticket desk with an offer of slightly different but acceptable seats. When I told her about the issues I had ben having regarding contacting them she told me that the sales desk were very short staffed and that there actually isnt a customer service unit at all in Cape Town. During this time we were travelling with friends around the Cape and at times were without internet so communications were difficult. I also began the process of trying to claim for the emergency clothing items that we had to buy. I am still trying to complete the electronic form which keeps saying that I am giving wrong information (it doesnt specify what it doesnt like) and I am simply completing each box in order as it request me to do - along with the uploading of the files they request. I have tried to complete this form numerous times and in the beginning with help from the baggage handling company who confirmed that I was completing the form correctly. To this day I am still in communication with Turkish Airlines requesting them to reimburse me. They have refused to reimburse us with the cost of the hotel & car rental and are fobbing me off regarding the clothing cost. I know that I am legally entitled to this so I will continue to press.",Detractor
" Dubai to Lisbon via Istanbul. In April, I booked a flight from Dubai to Lisbon for $530.90 with Turkish Airlines. When I received an email to check-in, I was unable to do so. I decided to call them to inquire why. They told me they cancelled my reservation and my credit card was flagged as fraud. I was told to provide proof that the credit card belonged to me so I did. First of all, why was I not notified that they cancelled my reservation? I even received an email notification to remind me to check-inâ€¦ After a long day of correspondence, they emailed me saying I can get the flight for the same price that I originally paid. I called to book my flight and they said it wasn't going through again so I had to use a different credit card. The Turkish Airlines representative then confirmed my payment went through and checked me in online. Great! I finally have a reservation since it was less than 7 hours till departure. When I went to drop off my bag at the Dubai airport, the Turkish Airlines representative said that there was no reservation for me. I showed him my confirmation AND showed him my online credit card statement that showed I had a charge from Turkish Airlines. He repeatedly told me I no longer have a reservation and need to buy a new ticket with a travel agency at the airport. He also told me I would be fully refunded when I submit a claim with Turkish Airlines. Again, why wasn't I notified that they cancelled my reservation? Why did they cancel my reservation after they already charged my credit card? It was 1 hour until departure so I did exactly what the Turkish Airlines representative told me to do. I bought a ONE WAY flight for $1306.98!! Since my flight in April, I've had a nonstop battle trying to get my refund. On Dec 19, 2018, Turkish Airlines called me to apologize for everything that's happened. She admitted it Turkish Airlines' fault and that they didn't follow their protocol which resulted in them cancelling my reservation. She asked me to send a copy of my passport and my credit card statements and that I would get my full refund in one week. Since that phone call, Turkish Airlines has completely ignored me. I've tried contacting them Jan 4, Jan 6, Jan 9, Jan 15, Jan 16, Jan 20, Jan 22, Jan 25, Jan 29, Feb 1, Feb 4, Feb 14, and Feb 20. Every time I've tried contacting them, they either do not respond to me or the call center tells me they'll mark my case as urgent and someone will respond to me in 48 hours. I have not ONCE heard back from them ever since I was told I would get fully refunded in Dec. Why is their protocol to respond within 7 days or 48 hours, but it's been 2 months now and I haven't heard from them yet? Why did they not follow the proper protocol in the very beginning when I booked my flight? Why didn't they ever notify me that they cancelled my reservation? Why did their own employee confirm my payment went through and check me in? Why did they cancel my reservation when they already charged me? Why did their own employees tell me that they'll fully refund me, but aren't now? Why are they completely ignoring me? I feel like everyone should be aware how horrible Turkish Airlines is. I hope no one else has to go through what I've been through. It's been seriously affecting my health dealing with them. It's evident that they have horrible service and will not refund people (reading other reviews). Please- save your money, time, and health, and book a different airline.",Detractor
" Montreal to Berlin via Istanbul. I was mostly disappointed with the services. I flew from Montreal to Istanbul and from the beginning I felt the experience to be flawed. There were some 28 business class seats and I had chosen a seat with direct aisle access. The seat is quite comfortable and large was what I noticed at first. The cabin crew was awful. They congregated at the forward cabin near the bar and watched us settle in. As we were in the middle of winter, passengers all had heavy winter coats. I was seated in row two and could overhear some passengers asking the crew if they could take their coats. I was a bit taken aback by the crews response: ""No, later, later"". Needless to say, I was not going to go out of my way to ask them to take my coat and instead opted to leave it at my seat. The crew members did not offer to take my coat nor my neighbour's at any time during this 9,30 hour flight. We sat in the cabin at our seats with no drinks offered, no water bottle for at least 15 minutes. The crew came by after 15 minutes to offer us a selection of non alcoholic beverages. I declined the drink and was asked if I wanted anything else and I ordered champagne. All drinks during our entire flight were served with no napkin and I thought this to be a bit odd since you get a napkin in Canada even on low cost carriers! Menus were handed out and we were asked for our selection later on. After take off, the service was not well planned. It took a while before any crew member came by and when they did they offered to make our beds! We had just left Montreal at 1045 pm and I suspect this is why they were asking us prior to even taking a drink order! I declined the offer for bedding and informed they that I would be ready for it after dinner. ""Of Course Sir, anything you want"". The response lacked being genuine and I felt the crew was somewhat irked. The service began with handling out a bottle of water, 40 minutes into the flight. We waited another 10 or so minutes and we were asked for drinks. The ""Onboard Chef"" came by to take our food order and this was also done in a chaotic way. He would take the order for 3-5 seats at a time and then disappear. The whole order taking for the entire business class must have taken 40 minutes. The food was served and it was beautifully plated. I can't say the food tasted better than any other overseas carrier I've flown in business class. The onboard chef seemed like it was all a show and I could not really see how he was a chef. He took our order (chefs don't usually do this) and made sure the plates looked nice. I think that is the extent of it and I don't really see any exotic or added value to this.During the whole meal, my drinks went dry for 10 or more minutes at a time. I have flown many carriers in business class and I have never had to ask or get up to ask for more wine with my meal. The crew in the business cabin were simply not friendly nor attentive. I also experienced the Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul during my connection. It is tired looking and circus like atmosphere. I qualified for the use of a resting suite. The attendant informed me she would come by to let me know when I could shower. I was there 3 hours, and she never came.",Detractor
" New York to Dhaka via Istanbul. Services at Istanbul Airport was horrible and totally unprofessional. I had a flight from JFK to Istanbul on the way to Dhaka and had a 12-hour long stay over in Istanbul. While it was written on the Turkish website that they would give a hotel room if the stay over is 12 hours or more, there was no such opportunity. Turkish airlines staff at the airport had limited English proficiency, lack of decency (rude), and lower motivation to cooperate. However, instead of a hotel room, a lady at the counter offered me snacks. When I requested for lunch instead of snacks or breakfast, the lady just tore the check she wrote in front of me. I was devastated seeing this non-professional rudeness. Only positive things were inflight hospitality and foods.",Detractor
" In 9/30/2018 my wife, our 11 months old son, and myself took Turkish Airlines to fly from San Francisco to Addis Ababa via Istanbul. Half way in the first leg of the flight (from San Francisco to Istanbul), a lady in the flight got sick and a decision was made to divert the plane to Bergen Norway, so the lady can get a medical treatment.  This caused 3 hours delay on our arrival time to Istanbul and we missed our second leg flight (From Istanbul to Addis) as a result. When we first got to Istanbul information was scarce and no one were willing to help. After a lot of leg work we finally reached to the â€œTransferâ€ station where we can request to be booked to another flight.  We were told the next flight to Addis Ababa is 24 hours later and the airline will provide hotel accommodations for us. They booked us to the next flight and refer us to another station where we can request hotel accommodation. When we got to the hotel accommodation station, we were told to get a visa and return. When we got to the Visa station we faced discrimination because my wife carried a passport from Ethiopia. Visa was offered to my son and myself who were carrying a US passport and denied to my wife who were carrying Ethiopian passport. When we asked why we were told they don't give Visas to people who carry Ethiopian passport. We showed them my wife's US green card and explain the situation we will face if we had to stay in the airport with a sick child for 24 additional hours and they still refuse to give my wife a visa. The only solution they offered is to leave my wife who was breastfeeding behind.  We tried to call the US Embassy in Istanbul to explain the situation, but they were closed for the day. Out of options, hungry and tired, we finally decide to stay in the airport for the next 24 hours. We returned to Turkish airlines terminal and asked if we get admittance to the Turkish airline lounge, so our child can rest in a comfortable area and this request was denied because we are not Turkish airline business customers. For the next 24 hours, we were prisoners in Istanbul airport. I regret my decision to fly Turkish and I will never fly them again.",Detractor
" My first time on Turkish. It's not a bare-basics, race-to-the-bottom product, but it's far behind Asian carriers and Qatar Airways in warmth and sophistication. There is a lot of confusion both in the cockpit and at the Istanbul transit area. Passengers are given the wrong information. My flight ex-KUL taxied all over the airport for 2 hours before returning to gate for refuelling. (We were just about to take off on a 11.5-hour journey with not enough fuel? Interesting.) That just about put paid to everyone's plans to catch their connecting flights. The gate number for my Geneva flight was different from what the entertainment system showed us right before landing (as I found out after sprinting, laptop and shoes in hand, to the wrong gate). Very stressful. On board, food is okay but same-same across sectors. English is not great unless pre-recorded. Male crew are quite patient and hard-working. The female staff can be pleasant when they want to be. Sadly, many make it very clear that having seen the world and having put peroxide highlights in their hair, pouring coffee in economy class is not where they want tp be. (How hard is it to say ""Good evening"" to a passenger during boarding, instead of giving an icy, silent stare?) In the future, unless I decide to travel to one of the secondary destinations served by TK, such as Salzburg or Lyon, my preference will remain with the more established airlines.",Passive

"  Vienna to Istanbul. Our morning flight was delayed then eventually cancelled due to the bad weather which is understandable. We had to rushed back to counter for them to issue another boarding pass and during this time it was already chaotic. Then they gave us options whather to take the next earliest flight but will arrive in Istanbul Sabiha airport and not Istanbul Ataturk airport. Another option is to take another flight but had to wait for another 9 hours. We took the first option because Turkish airlines promise that our luggage will be sent to Sabiha airport when we landed. Once landed, waited for around 45 mins - 1 hour for our luggage but none arrived including others that took the same option as ours. Few minutes later one of the staff came and informed us that all the luggage are left in Vienna. This became even more chaotic as passengers have other arrangements and obviously requires the luggage. The staff told us to file baggage lost at the counter and the queue itself took almost 2 hours. Turkish Airlines again made another promise that they would send it by the next morning to our hotel but again we still have not receive our luggage the next morning. Fortunately our hotel staff helped us to follow up on this matter and again Turkish Airlines made another promise that the luggage will be sent tomorrow evening. So day 3 In Istanbul with recycled sweaty clothes and no luggage. We are really hopeful that it will be sent by tomorrow evening as we are going back in few days.

 Istanbul to London. On our flight back from Istanbul we handed our baby stroller to Turkish Airlines. When we arrived to London we realized that the stroller was damaged. We started a claim case there at Heathrow airport. An online account was opened for us through which we filled in more information and received an evaluation which said that that THY would compensate the repair. We ordered two pieces of replacement covers and sent the receipts to THY. This was on the 19th of January. Since then we've been trying to resolve the case but we are being ignored. Today I talked to customer service for the 5th time. Every time I'm told that we should hear back in couple days but we never do. This is such a shame. What we claim is not even that much. If we were this responsive when we owed any money to THY we would be fined multiple times. They are getting away with it. It's such a shame for a company which claims to be world class. It's obvious that the quality they stand for is disappearing quickly.,Detractor
" I am flying from Vienna to Singapore with a layover in Istanbul for 11 hours. I selected this long layover knowing that I had much shorter routes with the only intention of taking the Sunday 4:00 pm free tour around the city that Turkish Airlines provides to itÂ´s travelers when they have long wait at the airport. Prior my flight, I confirmed via phone with Turkish Airlines that there was no need to make a reservation and that as long as 1 person would like to make the tour, that would be sufficient to do it and that I needed to be at hotel desk 30 min before the start. As soon as we landed I rushed to the desk office but the passport control took about 50 minutes and I arrived at the desk at 3:50 pm (20 min later than expected). Although I was late, I did see that the tour group was there with the guide, getting ready to leave. I asked at the desk if I could join and they told me ""No, tour is finished"". I was not going to take no for an answer as I had chosen Turkish Airlines and a 11 hours layover flight (instead of 3) to jump on that tour. The manager approached me in a very rude way and told me that she had to leave and that the buses were full. She said that she could put me in the tour but that there was no space for me (in the website clearly states that as long as 1 person will be interested in the tour, it will be arranged). According to her excuse, she had 62 people ready to go and that was exactly the maximum amount that she could take. It is interesting, to say the least, that apparently I was so unlucky that I was the only person that was left out out of an exact number of 62 people. It is really hard to believe that the group of tourist standing next to me at that same moment was 62, when it looked more like 20 people. This person was extremely rude and zero customer oriented and did nothing to help me in that situation or to find an alternative. All she did was to yell at me and say that if I was not happy that I should open a claim (so that's what I'm doing now). I would like to highlight that all I wanted was to do the tour on my way to Singapore and it would have been really easy for her to make it happen. Instead, now I want a compensation.",Detractor
" Seychelles to Birmingham via Istanbul. Absolute joke of an airline. Booked a last minute ticket to get back to the UK for a family emergency, currently sat grounded on the tarmac at Istanbul with a small baby- it's been 2 hours and they claim it'll be another hour at least and just receiving a long list of stupid excuses and then no reason at all for another hours' delay with the most recent update.

Pre Boarding failed at the families on hand did not understand English or Turkish languages. Boarding on to a new B737 was quick and excess cabin bags was controlled strictly at the gate. The cabin was very new, with a light and bright feel. The seat where average economy seats with reasonable leg room. The plane featured over head TV screens that showed a cheesy lego based pre flight video. The cabin crew was very good and offered an efficient service. Drinks where served after takeoff and a very Turkish meal was served an hour later, featuring rice, vegetables and kebab meat. A vegetarian option was available that looked like couscous. Drinks included fruit juice, sodas, beer and white wine. Inflight entertainment was limited to music and radio on 8 channels. Overall it was a pleasant flight and the seats where OK.",Passive

I quickly slipped into the business line and saved 20 minutes from the check in process. When we all assembled in the depart lounge the pre boarding sequence went out of the window. People standing closest to the door where on 1st. This ruffled a few business travellers big time. The airplane was a well used and tired aircraft, the interior was well used & featured cramped and un comfortable economy seats. Boarding was swift and the crew did a manual safety briefing, before a quick take off. The inflight services was a limited range of drinks and tea. The meal options where greasy riced based meals with donner meats. There was no flight entertainment.

" Istanbul to Tashkent. Got to the departure longue to find utter chaos, 100s of local people trying to board a flight, each carrying with 3 or 4 cabins bags, wedding dresses, quilts and electrical goods. The Turkish airlines staff did their best to bring control and remove bags from shopping happy Uzbeks. The boarding sequence did not work either. Reminds me of a rugby scrum at its best. We were bussed out to a well used aircraft with a very dated cabin. When I got to my window seat I found both seats full of stacked bags. Which had to be removed to the frustration of their owner. Turkish Airlines had an extra 6 or 7 staff on the flight trying to move what seemed 2 tonnes of bags into the hold and to sit people in there assigned seats. The flight had a delayed takeoff, which gave you time to look at a very tired interior, seats were old and lacked support. Leg room was zero and there was no IFE or video screens. The crew gave a manual safety demo and had to control people who wanted to change seats. The flight itself was OK, there was a basic drinks service and a simple meal of kebab meat and rice, there was no vegetation options that I could see off. The crew enforced a strict liquor policy from take off which worked well. Landing was OK and we where loaded into a bus from a remote parking space. Transit through Visa control and baggage collection was fast by Uzbek standards.",Detractor
" London to Istanbul. The departing gate and boarding experience was good, people boarded quickly and the sequence worked well. The cabin of this new 737 was clean and bright, for a economy seat the legroom was ok with a standard seat pitch of 34 or so inches. A cheesy safety video was shown before takeoff featuring lego figures. A little too cheesy after been shown twice, once in Turkish and once in English. Drinks were served after take off in a punctual fashion and was soon followed by a superb in flight meal of lamb kebab and rice, a good looking vegetarian Dahl was available too. Drinks included average wines and rice beer, along with soft drinks and Turkish coffee. The cabin crew where good and well turned out, including a chef working in the galley for business class passengers. The rest of the flight was fine. This plane did not feature IFE, other than some magzines. We were disembarked at a remote stand and spent 20 minutes on a bus trundling across a dark airfield to a packed transfer hall.

" I was flying from Alexandria to Atyrau through Istanbul on Jan 15, 2019. The luggage was tags were printed fine all the way to Atyrau but the Turkish Airlines Supervisor asked the agent to check it only yo Istanbul. He was rude and obnoxious. He claimed that this was because I have two different ticket numbers which is very common anywhere else on earth. He said the same to someone else who was going to London but he received a phone call from superiors to make this passenger luggage go all the way to London. When I complained, he threatened to float my flight. He was shouting at everyone and when when his colleagues offered to intervene, he shut them down.

 Mumbai to Los Angeles via Istanbul. The estimated departure of TK9 (BOM-IST) was 6:55 am which actually departed at 7:55 am it was delayed because of some connecting flight and other reasons. My experience in both flights form BOM-IST and IST-LAX was way too different. BOM-IST review: Communication: The communication done by the pilot with passengers was awful they spoke something in Turkish and mumbled some English. All I understood was word THANK YOU. The quality of speakers used for the announcement was very cheap. The flight crew had a very different attitude in this flight they didn't communicate well with passengers and was just doing work like robots. Not listening to queries and moving on with next passengers. They didn't even greet their incoming passengers. Food quality was OKish. No menu card was provided. Overall the Flight was clean with old interfaces. My front seat was torn apart with some internals clearly seen. IST-LAX review: The communication was very clear in English the speakers were fine. The cabin crew was friendly and accommodating understood passengers well and heard all my queries. Helped me with my bags. Greeted us while coming in and going out. Food: Food was awful. When given meal preference was an Asian vegetarian meal please for god sake dont serve ITALIAN PASTA. Menu card was provided. Flight: This flight was cleaner with newer interfaces and good seats. The flight arrived 1 hr late. Overall Review of Turkish Airlines: Istanbul airport security lady was extremely rude. She can't even understand basic English. Passengers are in hurry and tired and in that mindset even such small things make a big impact on passengers. My Mumbai to Istanbul flight was awful and Istanbul to Los Angeles was good. They do really discriminate passengers from different regions. Providing different services to different passengers.I have traveled quite a lot but never gotsuch treatment.,Detractor

" Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn't select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn't select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was ""it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass"""" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn't have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I'm not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport ""the next day."" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn't end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn't have my bag. Then they said that they couldn't pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a ""repair invoice"" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu. At that point I had already thrown my damaged baggage away.",Detractor

Cheap stuff. For an around 6 hour flight, no menu cards were provided. The crew serving never bothered to ask if passengers needed anything. One had to look around what others were eating and ask for it. The worst part was the next flight, from Istanbul to Frankfurt. It was again A330-200. And everything on this flight was perfect.

As a result, we had to buy another ticket on Turkish Airlines for 18th December 2018 at the airport which cost us TRY 21519 and this was through no fault of our own.

I received another priority pass to went through the passport control. My bag arrived on time also. Overall, the airline itself had a good service and business class facilities but the crew should be more friendly and the airport issues should be fixed.",Passive
" Vienna to Riyadh via Istanbul. Biggest problem with this airline is its home airport. Istanbul Ataturk has huge capacity problems. Because of that most flights are delayed and there are no places to sit while waiting for a delayed flight. Then really amateur services kick in when the employees start calling for all passengers to group in the back of the room for passport check only to move again to the front after that for the boarding. The fact that I booked extra legroom seat and a plane was changed without any notification (resulting in regular seat) only adds to an unpleasant experience. This was not a low-cost flight, but services appeared so. Food and on-board services won't fix these problems.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Abuja. Turkish Airlines switched my seats selected through online check in, so that my family was separated. There was no need for this that was ever explained to me, leading me to conclude it was carelessness and incompetence when I did my baggage drop. They changed my seats during baggage drop. Then, they messed up and put an infant in an emergency row seat. So then I had an infant put beside me along with his father, whereas before that I had an empty seat beside me. No apology from the staff. Terrible organization and service. Will not fly them again.",Detractor
" Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut. We have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. To start, we have booked our Christmas tickets on July 1st to secure a place for a fair price. The night before the flight. We go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from Istanbul to Beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from Brussels. The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100â‚¬ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360â‚¬ per person to 680â‚¬ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn't do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. To try to rectify the situation, I have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. After staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. Missed our solution option with the plane leaving. I stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. Our file is ""still in process"" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. This company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. Insults the customer and their intelligence. Hires people who neither have the proper English nor the empathy to deal with a client. Is frustrating and shameful. I am missing important family moments I have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. As for recommendations if you want to go to Beirut. Pegasus, a low cost, is much more efficient and respectful. Middle East airlines was definitely a good experience, I had a problem once with Aegean airlines, but they solved it on the spot not leaving for me room to complain.",Detractor
"  Paris to Dar es Salaam via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is at best unreliable. The nightmare started in August but let me say all in until I travelled in December I changed the ticket 3 times. Every time 'schedule changes'. Then when I travelled, they lost my bag. When they found it, there was a missing item! I wasn't alone missing a luggage at the airport. Turkish airlines is just very unprofessional. I bought their ticket because of competitive prices, but if I calculate the ticket price and the time and money to call them (because of their issues), I should just have bought a ticket from a superior company like Emirates or Qatar. Spare yourself from ruining your vacations and avoid these unprofessional people!",Detractor
" Vienna to San Francisco via Istanbul. Flight experience was ok and satisfying. Customer complaints handling a disaster. TK did not credit status miles as on the ticket. But no way to get an answer why. All online contacts tried. Autogenerated answers, refusal to accept messages in language of home page. Refusal of message because form not filled completely (no miles and smiles number, we cannot deal with your message). And last ""You may contact with related Airlines customer service for the transactions"". All from email accounts that would not accept answers. My take is clear: TK does knowingly produce wrong and misleading information on tickets, and laugh at customers asking for remedy for non provided services. Hence, neither me nor any company member I have to authorize will fly TK from now on.",Passive
" Istanbul to Los Angeles. Ground crew is just terribly unhappy. Rude and condescending. They are unhappy with their jobs and it shows. None of them actually care about their company which reflects on the leadership. Therefore the customer experience is bad all around. You get what you pay for and that's Turkish airlines for you. The incident that prompted this review is the fact that I dropped my glasses. I waited for all the passengers to leave and then started looking for them. As I was looking for them, their crew instead of helping asked me to leave the plane assuring me that they will look for it and bring it to baggage claim. When I reached baggage claim they said wait for a few minutes and we will let you know. Another 15 min go by and they found them, told me to pick them up at the check in counter at departures. So I walk up there and the lady at the desk is just unhappy. She tells me it'll be 45 min and they can't mail them to me, So I wait. One and half later someone shows up with glasses that are not mine. They said wait till we find more, two more pairs come up and still not mine. Another 45 min go by and nothing. So basically 500 dollar glasses down the drain. Bottom line, if you drop something don't leave the plane, they will try to push you out and then they wouldn't care. I would say go pay a little more and pick better service. It's not that I lost something, it's how the crew treated me after having dropped an item that I could have retrieved if they had let me look for it",Detractor
" Turkish Airlines needs to offer transfer service options (maybe even check in at pick up location) like Emirates does if it wants to remain competitive as the current arrangements for the new Istanbul Airport are greatly inadequate. The check-in kiosks are still not operating reliably. TGS staff were present to offer assistance. However I can not see TK moving all operations in less than a month without damaging their overall product and reputation as the new airport still lacks a proper lounge (the Turkish Airlines Corner arrangement although a improvement from a weeks ago still just a makeshift), restaurants, retail and other basic facilities. Boarding conducted in a orderly manner and on-time departure. The 2Ã—2 seating business class product on this fairly new 737-800 is as good as it gets with IFE and ample space. The breakfast offering was of good quality with a tasety Turkish cheese selection and cold cuts. The scrambled eggs main dish was average. Very good selection in the bread basket. Attentive crew and smooth landing on time arrival to Baku, which is probably the best airport in the region and a pleasure to fly in to. TK offering a very good onboard product with major shortcomings on the ground, IT and customer service side devaluing their product.",Promoter
" Turkish Airlines is the best domestic service and value within Europe. Turkish domestic flights across the board are quite cheap by EU and US standards, having paid $40 for a flight comparable to Boston-New York or London-Paris. Boarding was quite speedy and orderly, and what a treat to be on an enormous long-haul aircraft like the Boeing 777-300ER on such a short route, really feels special. Legroom and seat width are stellar by domestic or international standards, with a very neat and clean appearance. Inflight entertainment was not activated for this roughly hour-long journey, but a standard Turkish-style warm cheese sandwich was provided, the quality of which rivals $9 buy on board options in the USA. Cabin crew, of course, were professional and quick but not rushed. Arrival into Izmir was smooth, and we arrived at an actual gate, as opposed to needing to take a bus from a remote stand. Overall, this journey was well worth spending a few more bucks than the bus or flying Pegasus.",Promoter
" Istanbul to Bangkok. Old plane, when boarding no air flow in 10-15 min, Bad Air until air con started. Warm food and dessert was ok taste, but side dishes, salads etc, I could not eat. Normally I eat all in airplane. After eat, cabin was quite hot. I inform level of the temperature to air steward, but not much change. Its better sleep in cooler, because you have blanket, clothes to add on! Even cheap ticket cost, I like to pay 100e more, for decent air carrier.",Detractor
"  Toronto to Cairo via Istanbul. Worst experience ever. On the way to Cairo there was a snow storm and all flights announced that they will be delayed. Turkish Airlines insisted that they will leave on time, instead we were all boarded and locked inside the plane, on the ground for 3.5 hours! Because of the delay, I missed my connection flight, which happens all the time. The issue was how they handled it. We were given no information on the plane on what to do now that we missed our flights. We just had to walk around and ask randomly. They said we have to stay in the country as there are no flights till tomorrow and that they will pay for the visa we purchased. They put us in a hotel and I contacted them 11 times and objected twice as they refused to pay me back for the visa purchased. They finally agreed to pay only 28 USD but what I actually paid was 70 USD. On the way back , they were also delayed for 3 hours and again I missed my connection flight and the exact same happened. Only this time they had no straight flights to Canada. So I had to fly to Heathrow and from there to Toronto. Workers are rude and they told me : well, if you think we are always late then just don't take Turkish Airlines. I hated every aspect of that trip, they need to work on their customer service. All I wanted from them was to give exact and clear information on what can be done to deal with them being late. Instead, they just let us wander around and wasted Everyone's time. Never again will I go with them even if the alternative is more expensive.",Detractor
" Ankara to Frankfurt on Turkish Airlines. Quick check in using the priority counter. Following passport control headed to the lounge which was too warm and had the very basic selection of food and beverages. This lounge is worlds away from TK's lounge in Istanbul and one of the worst I have ever visited. The WiFi did not work despite repeated attempts. Headed to the gate well in advance of boarding time and much to my disappointment we were bussed to the aircraft when there were several vacant air bridges. On board the hard product was decent and having chosen an emergency exit row I had plenty of legroom. The service was extremely slow and by the time I received my lunch it was already cold. Food was well below the standard I had come to expect from TK and I see this as a telltale sign of service deterioration. FA's went about executing their duties as if they were on autopilot. The IFE had a good selection and like my inbound journey, the audio jack did not work well causing frequent loss of audio. The flight departed and arrived on time. Despite being tagged as â€œPriorityâ€ my bag took considerable amount of time to come out and was delivered well after those that were not tagged as such. I have been using TK regularly in recent years and the decline in quality has been steady. The next time I travel to Turkey, I will most likely choose a different carrier.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Ankara. Checked in well in advance as I was connecting from an overseas flight. The agent had difficulty locating my reservation despite having been presented with an electronic boarding pass and my passport. At the gate, boarded with the priority group given my status on Star Alliance. On board, the hard product looked good and with the exception of my audio jack the seat functions worked well. Following take off we were offered lunch with two options for main course. The food was tasty for economy class and the portions were OK. Several beverage choices including beer, wine and spirits were offered. The IFE had a glitch where every movie choice was directed to the wrong film each time. The seat was comfortable enough for economy. The flight pushed back and landed on time. I have taken multiple international and domestic flights with TK in recent years and as with my previous flights, this one had passengers standing up and walking to the front of the aircraft while taxiing. The FA's did not force them back to their seats and simply replayed the pre-recorded safety message. As a result, the plane taxied for about 10 minutes with several passengers standing in the aisle and opening overhead bins risking the safety of others around them. Whilst most of my on board experience has been pleasant with TK I am appalled to see that their FA's do not enforce the most basic safety rules and simply ignore violations. This is a very concerning display of TK's safety culture and raises questions about the rest of their operations.",Detractor
" Ankara to Amsterdam via Istanbul. After a mediocre Business class flight to Turkey with them, we decided to stay at Economy for our flight back. The IFE is pretty good and worked well for me. Food and drinks are also okay. However cabin service was way too slow for a very short ESB-IST flight which over-hastened the eat and drink joy for half of the plane. IST-AMS service was alright, although the food quality is drastically decreasing. Their ground service and staff have major setbacks everywhere, only getting worse. Also, the seat pitch for both flights were literally terrible - barely 30 inches each. Their economy seat pitch does not put them above the category of low-cost carriers. They used to be my favorite airline, not anymore. I no longer prefer them if I have another major airline option on any route.",Detractor
 San Francisco to Mashhad via Istanbul. Worst airline ever! I bought the tickets 6 months in advance. After two months they send me a text message that the connection flight (second flight) has been canceled!

"  Amsterdam via Istanbul to Havana return. I'm really satisfied with the overall performance of THY. The seat pitch is quite good. A lot of choices and a very good responsive personal entertainment system, the food is really good and the quantity of the food they offered you is certainly enough. You receive an amenity kit on the long haul flight, which is a nice touch. There is live television and WiFi on board, but the Wifi was quite expensive. The live television worked perfect, I could watch a live soccer match! Downside is that the crew sometimes a bit tired looks and act. The layover in Istanbul is a bit chaotic. My bags arrived in Havana and also on the way back in Amsterdam. My conclusion is that Turkish Airlines offers a good product, when you compare it with the price. I would choose them again and can recommend them.",Promoter
"  Dublin to Phuket via Istanbul. Boarding queuing up everyone in the queue for a while they decided to call rows out we were nearly first going in and nearly last by the end not a good start, went down hill from there on.  Seats mixed up even though we asked for certain seats luckily some people swapped with us - we asked one one of the staff could they please sort the seats out, they didn't care. We had to do it ourself as we have 2 small daughters not sitting beside us. Nothing for kids no kids menu or kids toys or colouring books to keep them entertained for the flights. .The staff from Istanbul to Phuket were the worst most miserable people we have ever came across on a flight.

" Amsterdam to Ankara via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is a difficult airline to review with varying ups and downs. Business cabin is pretty good with comfortable seating but without an all-aisle access layout that misses window seats for this. IFE screen size and selection is very good but there was a problem with my system which had to be rebooted for 3 times and I could only start a movie near the end of the flight, and I could not finish of course. Although not perfect, cabin service is good, but ground service is undeniably terrible. I barely could catch my transit flight after a very long, chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of Ataturk Airport to the other. Many airlines, mostly from Asia, set the bar to a very high level recently which clearly pushes Turkish into a way lower tier for such treats. I would not pay a dime extra for Business and straightly prefer Economy class with this airlines, especially for short and mid hauls.",Passive
" Istanbul to Beirut. My flight with Turkish airlines was my worst experience ever. We were a group of 6 people travelling together and it happened that we faced many problems due to the disorganization of the airport and the airline. To start with, we arrived about 2 hours and a half earlier than our flight to the airport. We had to wait like more than half an hour for the passport control due to the congestion, noting that not all counters were available. Then, the staff were shouting on us to remove our shoes and get in the scanner machine and all do not speak English so we had many difficulties to understand what they want. How come that an international airport has only Turkish speaking staff, and rude staff. Next, we went to check in with tax refund process, and here, in this airport happens what does not happen in any airport in the world: They need to check your baggage, you have to open and search for the items in the airport in order to have your invoices stamped. What a shame. We got delayed due to this process, but still we were safe and on time. Due to the disorganization and the non helpful staff who were shouting on us and telling us to move faster when scanning our items, we lost a cell phone. We were told we had to go to the lost and found office and everyone you ask in this airport tells you to go in wrong directions so we got lost. We lost lots of time and we arrived at the gate 15 mins earlier, after running miles and miles to reach our gate after 15 mins of running. The staff taking care of checking passports was still available in the gate but refused to check our passports since boarding had ended 2 mins ago. We had to buy new tickets, even though we were at the airport and we checked in on time. Concerning Turkish airlines, we were told that we had to pay only the fare rates which is not too much because we are transferring our tickets, and we were surprised to know that the fare rates were higher than a brand new ticket. So we bought new tickets for all of us. Also to mention that we were told by the transfer desk of Turkish airlines and by the sales office of Turkish airlines that our bags were unloaded and they will be transferred to our new ticket. However, our bags arrived to Beirut with the flight that we missed, and when we were complaining about our bags they did not help us and were insisting that the bags are still in Turkey, till we showed them the pictures of our bags with our parents in Beirut, who managed to take them from Beirut international airport. This was my worst flight ever, I didn't receive any help from anyone in the airport and anyone from the Turkish Airline staff, but I was always told wrong information and sent in wrong directions and even my bags were not organized to stay and arrive with my new flight. This flight and this airport is never to be recommended.",Detractor

This airline tried to charge me Â£27 per extra kg when I told them I was taking donations across for kids in Uganda. My friends luggage got lost and they offered him nothing and didn't return any of his emails or calls whilst we were away!

"  I flew from Izmir to Montreal via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. I hadn't flown Turkish in 4 years, and was a little worried because of some of the reviews I have read. I had nothing to worry about. The flight was excellent from Izmir to Istanbul on a B777, even time for a small sandwich and coffee on the 1 hour flight. As usual, not enough gates at Ataturk airport, and we were bussed to the domestic terminal. This should be a thing of the past when Turkish Airlines moves to the New Istanbul Airport in early January 2019. A quick walk over to the International terminal and then boarded my flight to Montreal on a A330-300. The flight crew was excellent and had a good grasp of english. They were friendly and helpful. The infotainment system on Turkish is excellent with a wide assortment of movies, tv shows, and I loved the live TV. Two very tasty meals, a good selection of drinks, and snacks available in the galley throughout the flight. The restrooms were kept clean throughout the flight as I could see the flight attendants checking them often and cleaning if needed. The return flights were the same, excellent staff, bathrooms kept clean, food was very tasty. The only downside was having to be bussed to the International Terminal at Ataturk and it was pouring rain, the stairs had no cover. One of my bags didn't make the transfer to Izmir in Istanbul, but I reported it to Turkish Ground Services in Izmir, and it was promptly delivered the next morning. Again, this problem should be solved when the move to the New Istanbul Airport happens hopefully in early January 2019.",Promoter

After going through airport security twice, when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that, some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there weren't enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didn't say anything about them being there. Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce. The second meal they served (Mac and Cheese) was alright as well. I usually like Turkish's food, but this time I was actually impressed as they somehow outdid themselves.

TK has a few check-in counters operational for limited international operations. Self check-in kiosks were not available yet. No fast track either for security or passport control. No lounge, just a makeshift arrangement with limited service. Quite a major step backwards to the current arrangement for B/C and TK FFs at Ataturk airport. The terminal also rather unremarkable compared to other major hubs around the globe. Boarding uneventful and not very organized in typical TGS fashion. On board TK is very good as usual. Excellent breakfast served with inspiring menu and attentive crew. The hard product also very good with 2x2 seating, IFE and fresh looking cabin on this relatively new 737-800.

Cabin crew were professional and efficient in meal and drinks services. Enjoyed the safety video, if a bit cheesy! Some downsides would be only adequate leg room for a 6'3"" man like myself, expensive on board WIFI ($9.99 for a hour) and cabin crew turning a blind eye to foolhardy impatient passengers who insisted on getting up and opening the overhead lockers while the plane was still taxiing!

At the end they decided that 20 USD refund was enough for all the irregularities and for not arising out of this damage against the airline, employees, director, subcontracters and agents, they should head drop in shame, they told me to sign a letter. I had to carry a three wheel suitcase and buy another one in my holidays, besides plenty of time wasted.",Detractor
" Cape Town to Gatwick via Istanbul. I have used Turkish Airlines many times on long haul routes and find the combination of modern / new planes, attentive but not overpowering service, excellent food and free wifi in business class to be a match for some airlines and better than a good number. This trip to Johannesburg and back from Cape Town was comfortable with good meals. Transiting Istanbul Ataturk is always interesting although it is bursting at the seams. The Turkish lounge is vast but starting to look worn. I assume there is no desire to spend money ahead of the move to the new airport. Turkish remains my airline of choice.",Promoter
" Prague to Washington via Istanbul. Due to weather issue, most of passengers' luggage came a day after our flight landed. Everyone had to wait at least another one and a half-two hours or even more at the airport for this. That's okay this thing can happen. However, I talked to agents of Turkish Airlines about my luggage and their attitudes were terrible. I felt like I was the one who did wrong. They said I should've carried on the plane with me if I had something that important. I get it. I'm not saying it's not my fault at all. However, they should've not said that with that kind of attitude and treated me like I'm the one who made all this mess. I will not use this airline again. Very disappointed. Plus my seat was terrible. Don't know why, I wasn't able to push the seat back so had to fly 12 hours with the uncomfortable seat. I told one of the crew members about it but she didn't care so I just left it like that because I didn't want to make any trouble.",Detractor

 Edinburgh to Thessaloniki via Istanbul. Having read previous reviews I was a little worried as we were transferring through Istanbul with a very short time between flights.

All in all I was pleasantly surprised and I would travel with them again.,Promoter
" Lvov to Johannesburg via Istanbul. The first leg was flown by a A321. Check-in was smooth and efficient. The plane seemed to be pretty old, with an old school PTV - there is PTV, but it's not touchscreen nor anything on demand, you could only choose from the few existing channels. Since it's a flight less than 2 hours so it's not a big problem. A excellent light meal was served. I had a long layout in Istanbul so I left the airport for a while. Istanbul airport was a bit crowded, that's why the new airport is opening soon. The next flight, IST-JNB, is on a A333. The food was also good - probably the best food I've ever had in economy, but there's only one option if you didn't book special meal, so it might be a problem with some people. The seat pitch wasn't very good for a long haul flight but still acceptable. Amenities were good. Overall, I was impressed and would definitely like to travel with TK next time.",Promoter

Specially for a long flight and you don't want to bother with their rudeness not only in the cabin but specially with their horrible check in counter staff can't care less. Also if you don't speak Turkish you are totally screwed. I flown to Asia before for 17 hours plus.

" We have just returned from our honeymoon to Mauritius of which we flew from London to Mauritius via Istanbul. When we checked into the flight (hours before departure) at London Heathrow, we mentioned that we were on our honeymoon to request some good seats or potential recognition of this monuments trip which is typically offered by other airlines. What followed was both underwhelming, and, quite frankly, offensive. On the 9 hour outbound flight between Istanbul and Mauritius, we were told at check-in that we would be allocated an entire Central row as the flight was not full, so we were individually allocated seats 15D and 15G (as the plane had 4 seats in the central row). Instead of being allocated the row as promised by the check-in attendant, seats 15E and 15F were allocated to two other passengers meaning that not only was this trivial attempt at recognition of our honeymoon trip not honoured, but we had to sit apart for the entire 9 hour journey to Mauritius! We were also told that we could not change seats even by the cabin crew when I spoke with them. A similar lack of empathy for our honeymoon was demonstrated by Turkish Airlines on our return journey also. In summary, if you are planning for a special trip (E.g. A honeymoon), I would strongly recommend choosing another airline as Turkish Airlines knowingly separated us for our outbound trip. Thank you for ruining our honeymoon journey.",Detractor

Naturally I had to go home as soon as possible, we had to cancel our trip. My son, who had lost his grandmother had to deal with the customer service employee who was unempathetic and dismissive. We wanted to change our return tickets which was from Hong Kong to Istanbul on Sunday and asked them to change it to Beijing to Istanbul on Wednesday. We were told by the Turkish Airlines representative we had to pay the price of a new ticket because our ticket was no-change, but we could get the refund after we present them with the death certificate of my late mother. We had to take this option as we had to be there on time for my mothers funeral. When I went to the Turkish Airlines office in Turkey after 10 days, they told me I cannot get a refund because I already used my ticket. I told them this is what the customer service told me, and the reply is ""There is nothing we can do"". But it was the Turkish Airlines representative who persuaded us not to cancel our flights and change them instead. Turkish Airlines deliberately gave us false information on this subject and lied to us for the price of two tickets!

" Istanbul to Vienna. Most arrogant airline I have ever seen. Asking people to be at the gate 1 hour prior to boarding, which then usually starts 10-20 minutes prior to departure. Sometimes only at the time of departure. No information from gate staff, never, whatsoever. Never apologizes for delay, simply never. Seat pre-booking doesnt work. E-boarding pass can not be issued for flights starting outside Turkey usually, so you need to pick up at the check in counter anyway and do the queue (we have 2018).

Then with a flight leaving at 10.35am - they decide to serve breakfast (about 11.30). Most of us have got up at 6 am to get this flight - what about serving lunch instead? However, this is all minor stuff - what really annoyed me is for the second leg of my return flight (Istanbul to London) they seated me and my partner apart. This is despite the fact that we booked our tickets ages ago! Forgetting common sense, you would have through it pretty basic - wherever possible, seat people who book together, together. It's not rocket science! Despite a call from Addis to Istanbul (which annoyingly cost me over Â£20) to their call centre - there is nothing they can do about this!

" Istanbul to Neveshir. This is a follow-up to my review first posted on 23rd Sept 2018. Well as it turns out, first impressions didn't quite last. Any frequent traveler would have experienced a delay in baggage arrival before, and this had to happen to us on this leg of the trip as well. Simple procedure right? Not with Turkish. While even other budget airlines can provide a proper and decent PIR (Property Irregularity Report), they couldn't. We went to the lost & found offices of 3 airports in turkey - Istanbul, Kayseri and Nevsehir, all of them got us to ""contact a different department"", bla bla bla, basically shrugging off responsibility and bringing us all over the world. When the baggage finally arrived at our hotel, it was an 18 hour delay. That's normal. What wasn't normal was that there were no forms to sign to acknowledge receipt of the baggage! The handling company said that ""we are a third party engaged by the airline"" and there was nothing to sign! While outsourcing of such responsibilities are normal, all other courier companies have let me sign a document at the point of collection to acknowledge receipt as well as to document the time of baggage arrival. So the story continues. When we finally managed to get our hands on a PIR, it was a computer generated one with no letterhead, no company stamp and no signature. A 9-year old could have reproduced the same document using MS word. Most importantly, it did not even state the eventual time of baggage arrival. How is any insurance company going to process a claim if a PIR does not state the time of baggage arrival? So now we are going around the world, from one department to another to yet another again, just to get our hands on a proper PIR. Case is not yet closed.",Detractor

Even though it was barely a 2 hour flight, it made the experience a lot more comfortable. Check in counters were smooth and efficient and did their job well. Seat pitch presented a decent amount of legroom for a narrowbody plane. Breakfast served was delicious too, and with metal cutlery no less! First time on Turkish and I'm impressed. Only downside are the long queues while transiting in Istanbul but I hope that would be sorted out after the new airport opens next month.",Promoter
" Manchester to Ercan via Istanbul. Check in at Manchester was fast and efficient in business class, the reason for that would become apparent later. Plane was due to depart at 1100 but when we went to the gate as advised, the inbound passengers were not being allowed to deplane as the next gate along was loading for departure and presumably the staff were worried that the passengers might get confused. Eventually, we boarded and found we had the business class cabin to ourselves. Plane left 45 minutes late and the service during the flight was, as to be expected, superb. Food was good and tasty and we were able to sleep on this section. The cabin crew were very good. Because of the delay, we were short of time in Istanbul and were ushered straight to our next flight bypassing security. The flight from Istanbul to Ercan was aboard a A321 with the 2+2 seating layout. Boarding for this flight was chaotic as is normal for this airport. The flight was only 1 hour 20 minutes so it was not too bad, but premium economy would be a better description of the business class cabin. The seats were not particularly comfortable and the seat adjust buttons did not seem to work. The meal on this flight was superb.

" Our flight from Venice to Nairobi provided a two-hour stopover in Istanbul.

You may say this is the airport's fault, but this was mainly seen from Turkish Airlines staff. The staff on my flight were a bit rude, and when you asked for something to drink, you would need to ask repeatedly as they wouldn't bring you a drink. Anyways, our flight was delayed from Istanbul.

We landed at London, only to find out that half of the plane's luggage did not arrive. All the transit flight luggage were missing and consequently delayed.

" Istanbul to Prague on Turkish Airlines. Following a smooth check-in processed by a helpful and pleasant agent we made our way to the lounge. The lounge was crowded but there was ample space compared to the cramped, noisy and hot main terminal. Istanbul airport is a nightmare unless you have access to the Turkish Airlines lounge. After a few beverages and snacks we made our way to the gate. Boarding started without an announcement and despite a clearly marked priority lane, it was a free for all with people forming multiple lines converging at the same spot. When I questioned the gate agent about the lack of announcements and the chaotic boarding, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said we were being bussed to the aircraft and in her mind it did not matter. On board the hard product was very good with real business class seats unlike the other European carriers which simply leave empty the middle seat of a 3x3 configuration in economy. After take off, we were served a tasty lunch with three different choices of main course. Beverage offering was decent and included champagne but the red wine was disappointing. The service by FA's was good but it seemed quite inefficient with the two serving the rather small business section running back and forth multiple times to deliver a simple drink request. The seats were comfortable and the IFE had a good selection. The flight pushed back late but arrived on time. The landing was a little unnerving when the aircraft touched down very hard and there was absolutely no explanation from the flight deck. Overall it was a good experience especially on board and in the lounge however, the Turkish Ground Services which is a contracted service, is major downside of this airline.

When I arrived in Istanbul, earlier flights are listed on the board showing which gate to go to. Since it isn't there, I asked an airport crew where should I go. He rudely told me â€œcheck on the board.â€ If the plane has flown, it's basic courtesy to inform me instead of telling me which gate to go to. After running all the way, I saw an empty gate. I went to a Turkish Airlines counter only to be sent from one counter to another. I was sent to other 4 counters in total. How you handle this situation is horrendous. I've never come across such rude, unapproachable and unfriendly customer service throughout my entire life. This is uncalled for and very disappointing.",Detractor
" Heathrow to Tashkent via Istanbul. Travel chaos as Turkish Airlines customer service nosedives at Istanbul airport. There was certainly no Turkish Delight on Turkish Airlines yesterday when passengers originating from London on the TK 1986 were left stranded in Istanbul because Turkish Airlines decided to off-load them because an overbooking problem on the onward flight. It's the first time ever in my 30 year career in the travel industry that I've ever been exposed to such unprofesssional service. Most airlines protect international passengers on feeder flights. Even though the flight arrived late, there was still a 30 minute transfer window and we all arrrived at the departure gate before boarding commenced, only to be told that we were all off-loaded. Disgrace, unprofessional service resulting in a 3 hour wait to get accommodated at 3 am in the morning. I'm amazed at how Turkish Airlines pretends to be a global player promoting Istanbul as a global travel hub, when it can't even deal with the basics. A truly nighmare experience. Looking forward to seeing how they resolve my ongoing problems! Travellers beware when booking international connections with Turkish Airlines - the cheaper fares could truly deliver a cheap and nasty experience you'll remember for a long time!",Detractor
" Malaga to Mumbai via Istanbul. Terrible customer service. My surnames were interchanged in the reservation (first in the place of the second and viceversa). They didn't allow me to change it even though I presented all the documents (ID, passport, reservation) to prove that I was the holder of the ticket. I couldn't rectify the data neither online, nor at the Turkish desk, nor on the phone and not even paying a change fee. The only solution they offered was to buy a full new ticket. I am a member of their miles and smiles program. As you can imagine I was not smiling.",Detractor
" Billund to Bangkok via Istanbul. Beside the very short connection in Istanbul that caused me had to run for the next flight, it was a quite good experience. It started with a friendly checkin staff that moved us to the emergency exit row so I had plenty of legroom for my 190cm. Service onboard was good with nice meal for a 3h flight, and crew was a very friendly. The only issue was that they was that they didn't provide gate info for the next flight from Istanbul and our 55 minutes layover was only 40min because of delay on first flight, so we had to run for the most remote gate. Flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was older B777 with 3-3-3 config, with legroom thais equal to Emirates B777 but wider seats. IFE not at the same level as Emirates and old screen. Friendly crew and nice meal. Seat selection is free on Turkish website under manage booking, thats a plus compared to that it has become expensive on Emirates on the 3 cheapest booking classes by Emirates.",Passive
" A disappointing start to our family holiday of a lifetime! Shocking customer service. No communication. Rude, aggressive and miserable staff. Disgusting airport in Istanbul, the list could go on. We were left for over an hour on our flight from Gatwick â€“ Istanbul, the captain came on the radio once to say we were delayed, obviously! No communication whatsoever. Cabin crew were rude and unhelpful. The plane then started moving, followed by taking off yet no checks to see if passengers were sat down or even with their seatbelts on. The plane just took off, not even an announcement was made. We missed our connecting flight to the Seychelles in Istanbul where 9 of us including a 4 year old had to wait at the airport for 17 hours. They were unaccommodating, rude and their customer service ability was non-existent and shocking. They said we could stay in a hotel if we paid for the hotel, taxi and visa. We were left at the transfer desk for 4 hours where we were just repeatedly told wait. They couldn't tell us anything or help us in any way. When they finally did sort our boarding passes out they had missed one of us off. After 4 hours they then said we could have a food voucher and a rest area, this was gone 4 hours of asking and waiting. When arriving at the rest area the lady working said we couldn't go in because we had the wrong passport. She found it funny when we pointed out to her that we had a 4 year old asleep in a trolley. She was laughing with her colleague which was infuriating and highly unprofessional. The toilets were disgusting. Another delayed flight made us miss yet another connecting flight to Dubai this time, this resulted in another 9 hours at Dubai airport. It took us 72 hours to get to the Seychelles where we missed 2 days of our holiday. We didn't think we would have the same carry on returning, unfortunately we did! Another 5 hour delay for what reason it was unknown. Going back to that desk at Istanbul with again rude and unhelpful staff was soul destroying. They then put half of our group in Business class half in economy. An absolute shambles. Never fly with this airline, they were horrendous in every aspect.",Detractor
" Dubai to Budapest via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is becoming the holiday destroyer. As usual I missed my flight to Budapest 11:55am and had to wait 6 hours for the next flight and lost almost one whole day in stay in Hungary.

Went to Turkish Airlines transfer desk to complain and informed me that they will compensate me with a food voucher to use in the food court!Aside from all of this Istanbul airport is the worst ever, cramped with people everywhere, toilets are horrible and rude staff.

" Detroit to Vienna via Istanbul. This is a complaint about the flight from Istanbul to Vienna (8/22/2018). I booked my flight since March 2018 from USA and have chose my seats in advance. I checked in at Detroit airport then again at Boston airport and received my boarding pass with the seat numbers that I have chose. During my actual flight from Istanbul to Vienna I was told that my seat is not available (6F) and was told to sit at 6D instead.. I went inside the plane, and I saw the entire seats occupied at (6). I notified the flight attendant, she said ok go back to the end of the plane. I refused to do so! She called the manager , and she told me that those people will not not leave their seats and that's I have only two options, either to leave the flight immediately and wait for the next flight or to go and accept seat 20C. The flight attendants were rude with me even during the inflight service. I don't think I will travel with this company again.",Detractor
" New York to Istanbul. Check-in staff at JFK airport were incredibly rude and unhelpful. I had very little time to board as standby and they held me up for ages over checking my carry-on because a group of them rudely pointed out to me there was no way it qualified as a carry on. (It had on Delta, however). Extremely unprofessional as a group of them stood behind the counter talking and laughing about me while I was paying to check my now extra bag. They were so cold and unable to empathize, that for that experience alone I would never willfully fly Turkish Airlines again. On the flight I pressed the call button twice because I never had time to grab water and the small glass they give you a couple times isn't enough for an 11 hour flight. My light was turned off both times and I was ignored each time. I felt sick the entire flight because I needed water desperately. Cabin crew were not very friendly and seemed quite stressed out. When passengers were up and confused about the direction of where to go they were curtly told â€œyou can't pass through hereâ€ and then ignored. No smile, nothing. Such a terribly disappointing experience. Oh and the bathrooms were out of toilet paper for a long time.",Detractor
" The plane was a fairly new A330-300 (TC-JOF, first flew in 2015). Boarding a Turkish flight used to be a challenge, but not this time. They divided us into business, economy row 27 which worked really well. Standard Turkish Airlines economy cabin, the seat itself not very comfortable, okay legroom. Not better or worse than any other economy seat on a wide-body plane. I usually love the food on Turkish Airlines, both quality and quantity-wise. However this time, the food wasn't as good as it used to be, especially the rice. (It hasn't been that long since I last flew Turkish). Quantity-wise it was fine, we got served dinner, snacks and a breakfast. The crew, on the other hand, was outstanding. Way better than any other TK flight I've taken. They were really nice and helpful, and actually wanted to talk to people! There were plenty of new films on the IFE system. I usually don't watch any films on the IFE, but I watched 4 films this time! We departed on time and actually landed early (I think they do it in case they need to fly around IST before landing). I got the in-flight Wi-Fi for 15$ and it worked fine.",Promoter
" Karachi to New York JFK via Istanbul. It was my first time experiencing with Turkish Airline. I bought 3 tickets and for most part this airline is rather cheaper than its competitors such as Emirates and Qatar. However, you do pay a price with horrible customer service and in flight food menu. Their customers service representatives provide nearly no accurate information. Staff won't be very polite and if you lose baggage you are pretty much on your own. Makeover, it is really challenging to understand the English language of their representatives over the phone.",Detractor
" Istanbul to Dubai. My flight was at 12:30am, and I was off to the airport by 8pm. Upon check in they told me the flight has been delayed by 30mins. Seeing as to how the domestic flight on Turkish I took (Kayseri to Istanbul was delayed a good 1.5hr just the day before, leaving my Friend stranded in Istanbul for a day due to a missed connection), I was dismayed. I asked the reception check in counter the reasons for a delay flight, and she shrugged it off and said she didn't know. I said well of all people she should have the best idea, it's ridiculous. Anyway with plenty of time to spare, and the crowded Istanbul airport boarding gate screening not having a gate number displayed yet, I spent a good 3 hours at various cafes and restaurants, periodically checking the board for my flight gate details. The thing was, my flight was not displayed. I realised much later that I had referred to it's revised flight departure time instead of its original departure time, making it confusing this really infuriated me at the airport. When it was very close to boarding time and i still couldn't detect my gate number, I queued at the Turkish Airline counter queue (which by now is full of passengers on several delayed flight), only to be told I had missed my flight! By then it was 30 mins before departure time and the gate was a good 20mins away. I ran like mad to gate 709, and there was no one left. I was hissing mad, this was not even my fault, a delayed flight with a horrible screen layout that couldn't even tell me 1 hour beforehand my appropriate gate details. And now Turkish airlines is refusing to refund this ticket or cancel the no show fee. I was stranded in Istanbul for another day and had to shell money out for another flight home. Horrific and worst airline experience ever. Throughout the ordeal all Turkish Airline ground staff were rude, short tempered and condescending. They never offered to help or apologise in short putting all blame on their passengers. I will never ever fly them again - hell they are not even the cheapest, just spend that few extra hundred to be on Emirates or other more reputable airline. They don't deserve to be in the skies and in business.",Detractor
" Singapore to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. For some reason the flight to Istanbul was delayed in about 25 minutes so instead of 75 minutes I only had 50 minutes for the connection. Once landed crew called all passengers to Tel Aviv to hurry up (a delay that was caused because of you), now obviously I was in a hurry and thought it's good that they are aware of the problem and since operating both flights probably leave the gate open a few more minutes. I got to the gate and they just closed it, the ground crew was still there and had last passengers on the jet bridge. Frustrating as it was seeing the plane just standing there for about half hour and the only thing separating me from getting back to my mother's funeral on time was a door. I tried explaining your employees about my special circumstances and hoped for some sympathy and possibly help. What actually happened was the complete opposite! I was mistreated and responded with apathy. I know and understand all airlines follow the same protocol but this was even worse than speaking to heartless robots. I asked customer service to please help me out and give me lounge access or even just a wi-fi that works so I can inform my family and friends I'm not going to be on time for the funeral or possibly find an earlier flight. The answer I got is: ""Lounge is only for business passengers"" so I'm not allowed to go there and I can use one of the restaurant's free wi-fi (obviously didn't work). So had to wait 5 hours for the next flight feeling like nobody cares and really trying to help me. It was not just one of your employees, I spoke to about 8 different people trying to explain my situation and they all kept sending me back and forth until I realized they are just trying to get rid of me. I would not fly with Turkish Airlines if known they are not able to get me in time for the funeral. I never post this kind of things, but I got such a disrespectful service! and think people should know they are the worst!",Detractor

" Washington to Minsk via Istanbul. I am a Deaf passenger. I called IST Hotel Desk office and Turkish Airlines Customer Relations prior to my departure to Istanbul for stopover and Turkish Airlines staff confirmed by phone that they will provide hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast for my long layover - stopover 20 hours after my arrival at IST on August 10, 2018 on way before connecting flight to Minsk, Belarus. Turkish Airlines Customer Relations asked me do not worry and promised that Turkish Airlines will take care of the hotel accommodation very well. They assured that there IST hotel desk will arrange to ensure hotel accommodation will be provided. When I arrived at IST and they refused dumped me away from standard service/accommodation and IST airport staff at hotel desk said that they will not provide me a hotel or tour with breakfast for my long layover 20 hours at Istanbul. I realized that Turkish Airlines is not honest did not follow ethics practice and fooled me against their advertising about stopover program with hotel and tour. I am concerned with Turkish Airlines's lack of integrity and assurance. I slept on floor mat during long layover 20 hours at IST airport. From my understanding, Turkish Airlines website posted all information online that economy class passengers will have a hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast during long layover. They treated me poorly because I am deaf passenger and passenger with disability. I do not appreciate Turkish Airlines' fraud with hotel accommodation or tour with breakfast that were not provided actually. I lost trust in Turkish Airlines. I feel regretting to purchase a ticket and choose to fly with Turkish Airlines. I spent wasted $30 visa for nothing at IST and I did not see Istanbul during stopover - long layover 20 hours.

" Bucharest to Dubai via Istanbul and back. The flight from Bucharest to Istanbul was ok, only 55 minutes time, but they provided snacks and drinks which is wonderful considering the flight time. Istanbul to Dubai on Boeing 777-300er, new plane and excelent cabin crew, they served dinner and beverages. The flight was on time. On the return leg, Dubai to Istanbul, the aircraft was Airbus A330-300, with a 2-4-2 configuration, which was better for us. The plane was a bit older than the previous one, but the entertaining system was ok, plenty of choices to watch. Cabin crew were wonderful, you can tell that they are hard working and also very professional. The only inconvenient is Ataturk airport because it is too crowded, there are a lot of flights departing and landing at the same time and you have to spend a lot of time in the aircraft untill take off and also after landing which causes delays. There weren't any problems with the luggage, but I think that the ground staff that handles the luggage should be more careful as the suitcases came a little bit damaged after the flights. I saw that they are throwing them quite hard when handling. All in all, I would recommend Turkish Airlines.",Promoter

Flight Aug 31st Kinshasa-Istanbul was delayed 12h, were forced to sleep at the airport because the company kept lying about the time the aircraft was supposed to land instead of getting us into a hotel. When entering the aircraft, they had booked 2, sometimes 3 people on the same seat, which created chaos among a group of already on-edge passengers.

I had to call them for the third time today just to hear that the guy has not even left the storage facility yet.

The airplane has true Business Class, with 2x2 seating (versus 3x3 with mid seat vacant). However, I was extremely disappointed by the food offerings.

I am sad to say it wasn't, the seat is fine pretty run of the mill business class, does what it says on the tin and had a decent sleep. Where Turkish airlines fails is in its customer service onboard along with the business class menu. Firstly the service on board, there wasn't any real interaction from the crew with their customers, menus' were given out and I was hurried to complete the breakfast menu for later in the flight, welcome drinks were not served until 20 mins after boarding, and champagne had to be requested. The main meal was served, and although it looked pretty it was pretty bland, I chose the chicken, it was dry and tasteless, I have had economy meals in the past and this spread was very much that but served on china. Way below what I have experienced on other carriers. The breakfast meal was just as bad, mainly all choices are based on eggs. Customer service on board, i had the feeling that the crew looking after its business class passengers were lacking in training to work in this part of the cabin, this was apparent from the lack of interaction, the crew spent all the time they could behind the curtain in the galley talking, never walking the cabin to see how their guests are.",Detractor

Toilets clean through the whole flights, even with fresh roses, toilet water and hand cream. A very nice touch. The staff on all flights friendly and very professional. Amenity kit with slippers, lip balm, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush is available and very much appreciated. All flights on time, arriving even ahead of schedule to final destinations. The only negative side is their hub: Istanbul Ataturk airport is overcrowded and dirty, staff unfriendly, even rude.",Promoter
" I travelled with Turkish Airlines from Calgary to Nairobi via Istanbul on July 1st (arrived on the 3rd). When I got to Kenya, my bags didn't make it. There were many other people in the same situation, as there was a big line up at their counter. After waiting for at least an hour, the agent told me the bags were in Turkey and that they would be delivered sometime in the next 2 days. I'm lucky I had some spare clothes in my carry-on. I called Turkish everyday ever since and just yesterday (July 4th) they told me they basically have no idea where my 2 suitcases are. All agents are very unhelpful and have no idea what is going on. I had a especially poor experience with one agent who was very condescending and didn't even try to search for answers. I left for a 14-day Safari on July 5th, and upon asking this agent how it would work for the reimbursement for the clothes I purchased, she basically gave me a lesson on how I should buy cheap things. Now, I'm stuck in Africa for 20 days with no bags, no clothes, and Turkish has not even offered me any type of compensation. I was travelling on Business Class and that's how they treat their Business Class flyers.",Detractor

"  Istanbul to Manila. Flying business class for me firstly means I will have a seat which lays flat and more personal space on my long haul travels, along with good food, drink and that certain feeling of being made important, so flying Turkish Airlines for the first time i wondered how they would rate against other carriers? Upon boarding my seat was pointed out to me, I had been settled for 15 minutes before any cabin crew made contact, when I was offered a pre flight drink, orange, lemon mint or water. I requested champagne, and waited another 5 minutes for this to arrive, albeit a very small measure. Flight under way and I was given a handful of menus, for dinner, drinks, wine list and a pre breakfast menu, again I choose champagne as my choice of drink, again I was presented with a small measure. Meal served and what a total disappointment - it looked good if it was colour and presentation you were looking for, and to be honest it was no more than an economy meal served on china. I had to ask for bread as this wasn't offered. Taste wise it was bland, and small in portion and I am unsure as to what purpose a tacky so called candle added to the experience. The toilets had me wondering, there were two in business class yet both were completely different designs, again both resembled what i would expect in economy. Seat was good, pretty run of the mill, IFE, dreadful choice of films & TV, no blockbuster films one would expect. I wanted Turkish Arlines to be good, sorry to say they are not, they are way behind other carriers on the Manila route, way behind other carriers on long haul routes, its certainly a case of running before they can walk.",Detractor
" Paris to Seoul via Istanbul. I lost my baggage and it took three days to get my baggage back. I know it could be happened for anyone to lost baggage, but I am very disappointed from this experience. The thing is, you can't imagine how their customer services are terrible. It's the worst. I called to their customer service center several times in a day to get the updates. They gave me all different information every time and that made me so confused. I tried to contact to the Korean office first, they don't know anything and have no rights to do something about this case and I spoke with four different people from English c/s division since I lost.

My first Turkish Airlines plane was late, and the second plane has gone 10 minutes before dest. time. The screen has shown ""go to gate"". But the plane was nowhere. Everybody was so rude at the airport, helpless and their attitude was awful. Finally I had to buy a ticket for the next flight for 342 pounds, because they told me, the plane us full, I can travel only on business class, where actually was a very poor service. Customer service a joke, it was the worst ever.",Detractor
" Zagreb to Singapore via Istanbul. All it takes is just one confident ground crew staff member who empathizes with the emotions of a passenger in distress over mistaking the flight-time 20:05 as the check-in time for 22:05. After a two-week holiday, my husband and I arrived at the airport to check into Flight TK1056. To my horror, I discovered that the gate was closed! And the flight was schedule to take off in 15 minutes! However, we were blessed by the presence of a ground-staff member. I regret not having asked for her name but thankfully, I had taken a snapshot of her while waiting to board the plane and I have attached her picture to this note of thanks. I only realised my mistake when I wanted to check in my luggage at 20:00. I asked the Zagreb airport information staff for help. She calmly and gently directed me to Turkish Airline staff who made a few calls for quick checks, and sprung into action. She got a ground-staff to re-open a counter and made a very quick check-in. She then opened up a channel all through the security checks, immigration process and all the way up to the boarding gate. In ten minutes or less, we were at the boarding gates. What I really appreciate most about her was her knowledge and understanding of the processes involved. She explained to us along the way, that flights from Istanbul to Zagreb had been delayed because Istanbul had experienced very bad weather that afternoon and almost all flights from Istanbul were delayed. So even though I had divine help in that my flight was delayed, I may not have been able to get on board the flight if not for this particular lady who went out on a limb and call in favours through all the channels of security and luggage processing to get our luggage into the cargo-belly of the plane and to rush us to the gate in time for our flight. Thank you, Turkish Airline and Zagreb Airport. On a separate issue, I also would like to add that Turkish airline is also very mindful of the needs of its passengers. I appreciate the night pack that was given during my red eye flight from Singapore to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Singapore. The night pack contains the most useful things for a more comfortable flight.",Promoter
" Zurich to Delhi via Istanbul. I landed Istanbul at 18:40 and after security checks and all took 25 minutes. My next flight was at 20:20. I was confused to go to which gate to take my next flight. I asked few people to find a way. I got to know i have to go to gate no 504. So moved to gate number 504. I reached there at 19:57. The guy who was at boarding counter told me that gates are closed. I told him how is it possible as I have the boarding pass and still there are 23 minutes left. Then he asked me to go to the transfer desk and assure me they will help me in this matter. I rush without debating to that guy and when I reached there the guy laughed at me and asked me to wait for 10 minutes. So that the 20:20 time can be passed. Then he came and ask me to buy new tickets. Instead of helping you mislead a customer and ask him to ran here and there. And the cost for the ticket is too high. When I paid the entire money and have nothing left out I asked them I have no money left for anything to eat. They told me they will provide food every 5 hour - once i got the new ticket and after 14 hour I reached them and asked for food and they denied even for tea. Next day when I boarded the flight, flight delayed for 1:30 hour and we waited without our fault.",Detractor

I went to Airport twice still Turkish had no idea where is my suitcase, so I bought some clothes and hygiene stuff. I kept my receipt. Monday I went back to airport because by phone I could not get respond. Monday by noon we waited there no suitcase. I went back to hotel and at 10pm my hotel customer service called and said my luggage is here. Suitcase was damaged but it was ok with me and I was happy to be able to give all the gift I bought to my sister. After I came back I send a receipt of my purchased items, Turkish send me $41 check as reimbursement.

" New York to Istanbul. Our flight to Istanbul (TK2) was at 7:05PM. The crew served dinner only at 10:30PM, NY time. My last meal was around 2.30PM. I was without food for 8 hours and because of my stomach problems, I started cold sweats, and had to take my medications to calm my stomach. I did have food with me, but because I stowed my bag in the overhead bin, I needed a flight attendant to help me take it because I am really short, and could not reach for it. I pressed the flight attendant button, but no one came. In the meantime, my friend who is in business class was saying that they were being fed non stop since they boarded until around past 10PM. Is it possible that all the flight attendant were there in the business class and our dinner was being deferred? I have flown countless times over the past 2 decades, and this is the first time I have been in a plane which did not serve food after the fasten seat belt sign turns off, considering that we only have 10 hours of flight, and another meal will be served before we land. The attention of the flight attendants to the economy class passengers is really poor. During the round trip flight, I was looking for someone to compliment for looking after me, even for just one bit of help, but no one i asked for help ever met my low expectations. This airline has a lot to learn from South east Asian airlines. Another problem. I asked my travel agency to get me a bulkhead seat. My travel agency said that the Turkish airline confirmed that I had a bulkhead seat both ways. Unfortunately, on both travels, my seat on both legs were behind the bulkhead seats. There seems to be a problem with the seat plan they are looking at, which is likely inconsistent with the real seats of the plane. I probably will not take this airline again.",Detractor
" Oporto to Bangkok via Istanbul. Flying to Bangkok to see my father before his operation was going smoothly until I arrived in Istanbul. The flight was originally delayed by 1 hour 50 minutes and kept increasing until we took off almost 5 hours behind schedule. The ground staff had no answer to my questions as to why the flight was late other than it happens often with the flights. Food was served but by the time I reached the front of the line it was finished and I was told 'sorry'. When the flight eventually took off, I was in a seat that was broken and wouldn't recline and the air conditioning was not working properly. I barely slept the entire trip due to stressing about not reaching the hospital on time, and we landed over 3 hours 10 minutes late, with a further 35 minutes before the doors even opened. I am so disappointed as the entire trip from Istanbul onwards was stressful, uncomfortable and there was a total lack of care. The return leg was much better, but I had to make it with a heavy heart. The cabin crew are friendly enough and the food is great, but will I ever fly with them again? I doubt it very much.",Detractor
" Singapore to Belgrade via Istanbul. I've used this airline several times, and each time it's been a pretty bad experience, mostly due to the service which ranges from average to terrible. On my most recent flight, my baggage (and that of many other passengers) arrived completely wet. Everything inside was wet and dirty which caused a great inconvenience for my whole trip. I was transferring through Istanbul and I guess it was raining there, but it was clear that the baggage had been treated inappropriately and carelessly.

" The aircraft was modern with excellent inflight entertainment options (latest movies were available). Food was tasty, and beverage options were great. Even during meals sandwiches and cookies were available. The toilet always has hand cream as well which was useful for our drying skin during the 11+ hour flight. The staff were friendly, and Turkish Airlines always gives out 'care packages' on long haul flights which contains chapstick, slippers, cream, socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothpaste and toothbrush. The airline's magazine is a good read. My flight was delayed by almost 4 hours so I did not reach my connection, had to spend the night in Istanbul. Turkish Airlines provided hotel, shuttle, dinner as they rescheduled me for the next day. On top of this, when I later contacted them about compensation, they fairly acknowledged the lengthy delay in getting me to my final destination and provided compensation as per current flight regulations. The Istanbul Ataturk airport also has plenty of shopping and eating options, smoking area. Overall my experience has been very positive with Turkish Airlines, despite the above mentioned hiccup which they fairly rectified. I would and definitely will fly with them again.",Promoter
" Toulouse to Singapore via Istanbul. Worst airline ever. Before boarding the plane, I chose to have my seats near the exits as I was 6 months pregnant. However, when I boarded the plane, I was told by the guy sitting next to me that I was not supposed to be seated beside him as he told the air steward that he wanted my seat for him and his son. I sat down anyway, as I was not told of it. 5 mins later, the air steward told me to change my seats to accommodate the father and son, and I was moved all the way to the back of the plane. Best part, I have requested for special meals to be served, however, they did not update my special meal request even when they were the one who forced me to have my seats changed. So Turkish is hinting me that you can paid for 2 seats and request for 3? Mind you, it was the seats in the first few rows.

" Miami to Bucharest return via Istanbul. One adult and two children were travelling. Check-in at Turkish counter in Miami was very smooth and quick. The boarding process was done by letters and was very without issues. Onboard I was impressed with the cleanliness of the aircraft and how new it was (no more than 3-5 years old). The Audio-Video Entertainment system was amazing and I would say probably the best I've ever seen with new movies, old movies, blockbusters, etc. The food and beverage selection was great. The kids received goodie bags and everyone received sleepers, toothpaste/toothbrush and sleep mask. The flight attendants were very attentive and smiling. The second leg, IST-OTP was great as well. Flight was operated with an A330-200 which I found odd for such a short leg. Very clean plane, relatively new and same great entertainment system. Flight time was 45 minutes but food was served as well. Return flights were great as well. OTP-IST flown on a B737-700 which did not have personal video screens but food was served and service was great. IST-MIA flown on the same B777-300ER and same great, attentive service. Turkish are still allowing two free checked bags for economy passengers. I would say Turkish service is on par or even slightly better than Lufthansa but at a much better price. WI-FI is available for a price but didn't use it. Charging ports present for each seat. Will definitely fly again.",Promoter

Nobody called for 6h so I called them back but this time the person on the other side of the phone said that there is nothing he could do other than transferring me to their complaints department. Typical TK and their miserable customer services. Now, this department simply does not exists in Turkish Airlines. There is no single person in the entire world whose case was solved by this department. I am sick of everytime getting their standard answer back like â€œOperational Reasons"".

" Mogadishu to Amsterdam via Istanbul./ I flew several times with THY, mostly because of their connections in Middle East and Africa. I hardly experienced planes on time, but delays were acceptable. Therefore I had never before to deal with their customer service. And that one is horrible, as I experienced. THY is not an Eurepean Airline, and therefore they do not have to commit to the European regulation with regard to delays. Although they state on their website passenger rights, which are almost a copy-paste of these regulations, they seems to be there to give you the impression that they take this seriously. My flight has delay due to an incoming aircraft which was late, and I missed my connecting flight. I had to stay over in Istanbul and needed to acquire a visa. Sounds easy. The delay is over three hours and they will reimburse the delay and the cost for the visa. In practice it is not easy to contact them, but finally I managed to get a customer service ticket. After 10 days a lot of regrets and a calculation that it was not their fault. They managed the calculation in such a way that the cause of the delay was only one minute less then the reimbursement threshold. Obviously the calculation was manipulated. For visa cost they advised to issue a new ticket with prove of cost made. I issued that request and asked for underlying documentation to support their calculation. After a while THY sent a voucher for the cost and did not respond on the question of proof. The voucher can be used only at the nearest sales office, and is valid for one year. Not surprisingly the link provided didn't work. The voucher can only be used by me. It is not likely I will fly with THY again, and therefore the voucher is worthless.

Only two minuses were baggage delivery at IST - the monitors are not updated regularly or are too small for such a big number of arrivals so our baggage was already out and we still did not see information about the belt and the staff at the SAW airport.

" Houston to Munich via Istanbul. Do not fly with Turkish Airlines, especially if you fly coach. The online booking system failed repeatedly from the day I booked three seats from Houston to Germany via Istanbul. I booked 8 months in advance. The flight times changed three times, no more than 10 minutes on any leg. I learned that if you have reserved seats and don't call the airline to say you agree with the changes, your seats are not reserved anymore. I was able to reserve three bulkhead seats for the 12 hour leg, but found that our seats were given to a family with a baby and we were moved to the row behind them, which would have been fine except that my son, who is 5'11"" tall could not sit with his knees facing forward because the seats were too close together. When the seats were in the recline position, my daughter who is 5'4"" tall, could not put her legs in the forward position! On our return trip, I tried for two days to reserve and pay over $210 for exit row seats and the Turkish Airlines web site could not process the payment. I tried this option using the iphone app and got farther along in the process, but it ultimately failed, as well. Each time the process failed, I would log out, then log back in and my account would show that our seats were reserved, but not I did not receive a confirmation and there were no pending charges on my credit card. After a few hours I finally decided to call the Turkish Airlines desk in Houston, but because of the time difference, it was closed on Sunday and would be closed on Memorial Day Monday. I then called the Turkish Airlines phone number, +90 212 444 08 492, and the customer service rep stated that two of the seats in exit row were reserved, but were not paid for and she suggested I pay for them online. I explained I was unable to pay for them online and wanted to pay for them through her. She explained that in order for her to do that, she would have to release the seats and they might get reserved by someone else. Since that was the only way I could pay for the seats, I approved releasing the seats - and within seconds the representative said the seats were gone.

" I was travelling from Antalya to Istanbul on 9th May 2108 Scheduled at 16:50 which was delayed till 18:20 take off, and had a connecting flight at 20:15 to London as our final destination. We had 1 hour and 45 mins delay from Antalya to Istanbul causing us to miss our connecting flight to London. We had not missed the flight completely but as we got to the gate the airport security said they cannot let us board the plane as Turkish Airlines have stop anyone from boarding 15 mins prior to take off. I spoke to the management in Antalya in regards to a possibility of missing our connection flight at the rate the delay was going. The staff was so calm and collective to say its all fine, you will be on the flight without issue. Bear in mind, hardly any of Turkish airlines staff on ground level can speak fluent English!. I wasn't to assured by his statement. No one in the Airport was helpful and wished to direct or instruct us in what can be done etc. These guys have no customer service or communication skills whatsoever. Just for a few mins of lack of management caused me and my family to wait another 12 hours for the next flight with no consideration about children at all. We was sent to hotel very late to get 2 hours rest with no food or drink and to top it off no luggage with us. Turkish airlines also lost my baby stroller which did not come out of with our baggage so I have had to fill out a form which mentioned someone will be in touch in 24-48 hours and no calls whatsoever and its been 6 days.",Detractor
" On a recent â€˜round-trip' experience, Denpasar - Budapest, I found myself in multiple disappointing (borderline traumatic) situations with Turkish Airlines. When checking in on my return flight in Budapest in May, 2018, I was told that my return ticket had been cancelled. As a result, I was forced to pay an additional $1,600 to purchase a new one-way ticket on the same flight. Below is a description of what had happened. In April, on the third leg of my flight from Denpasar to Budapest, I missed the flight in Istanbul due to confusion at the gate - poor communication and gate location (ie. heavy traffic surrounding this specific gate, the sitting area hosted multiple flights, unclear instructions and lack of announcements, etc). I had been sitting at the gate for an hour when they started boarding, but was only alerted when priority boarding started --- no more announcements or callouts were made thereafter. When the line began to peter out I started to get a bit concerned, but because there were still so many people sitting around me, which I had presumed they were waiting for the same plane, and no final announcements or staff had called out, I didn't move forward. However, at that time I did ask the people around me what flight they were waiting for, but they just shook their heads and said they did not speak English. At this point I was growing quite concerned and so I ran to the closest Turkish Airlines staff I could find, at a nearby counter. When I showed him my ticket, he began shouting (actually) at me and said that the gate was now closed and I had to go downstairs to the transfers desk. This was only a minute or two after the gate had been closed. I ran downstairs, showed them my ticket and asked what could be done. They said that I had to purchase a new ticket - no alternative was given. To do so, they ordered me to purchase a visa and exit through customs. When outside, I first rushed to ticketing at Turkish Airlines where an employee stated that I had to purchase a new ticket, but that he could not do anything for me and to go see the Turkish Airlines check-in desk. I then proceeded to the check-in desk at Turkish Airlines and they said that I had to purchase a new ticket. At no time I was told that this would render my return flight invalid, and no other information was given. I tried the help-phone for Turkish Airlines as well, but there was no dial tone and no-one was in the area to provide assistance. I finally had to purchase a one way ticket from Istanbul to Budapest for 200 Euros for a flight later that day. To add insult to injury, the Turkish Airlines staff was appalling - I was yelled at and belittled on numerous occasions. I've read other reviews and some have said that Turkish Airlines employees are inhumane, and to be honest, I agree - note: this is specific to the Istanbul Airport staff. My original ticket was over $1,400, and this whole ordeal has cost me an additional $2000. I reached out to Turkish Airlines and although they responded in a timely fashion, they were unhelpful and clearly had not read my story. Furthermore, the avenue of communication they use - feedback forms only, make it very difficult to communicate with them. I suppose that is what they want!",Detractor
 Our flight TK0775 Muscat to Istanbul was delayed about 1h 10 minutes and we missed our connected flight to Brussels. We were transferred to the next flight to Brussels TK1943 from 12:45 but due to mechanical problems only leaved Istanbul around 16:00. Our complain was answered by thy customer service within one week apologising for the inconvenience and offering a fair financial compensation. Refund has been done by Brussels sales department correctly. Delays are uncomfortable but probably inevitable with the crowded airspace and we can only appreciate the understanding and correct way our claim was handled.,Promoter
" Amsterdam to Seoul via Istanbul. I'm a Turkish Airlines Elite Plus (Platinum) member for the past 5 years. Turkish Airlines used to be great compared to most airlines with great service and amazing food. Unfortunately things have changed for the worse and in the past year or two their level has dropped down quite dramatically and I am now starting to look to change and stop flying with Turkish Airlines. Business class food used to be amazing, it used to rival Qatar Airways and some first class food in other airlines. Food level has dropped to the ground and is average minus compared to many other airlines. I have spoken to quite a few cabin chiefs and they all confirm that many passengers are complaining about the deterioration in their business class food and that management is aware of this problem. Quite sad. Business class seats are relatively aged compared to the better airlines. While other airlines have moved forward, Turkish has stayed behind. There is no privacy, and the configuration is an outdated 2-3-2 (B777) - I assume this won't be changing as it very expensive to change seat configuration. It seems like prices are constantly going up and while Turkish used to compete with the likes of Swiss or Lufthansa, prices these days are typically higher on Turkish Airlines. Service on board is mostly good with the onboard staff mostly very friendly and caring. Airplane age can be a hit or a miss with some very old and some reasonably new. In flight entertainment is typically pretty good.",Passive
" Boston to Toronto and then Toronto to Istanbul to Kathmandu, all booked as a single ticket via Turkish airlines. As soon as I arrived to my connecting flight with AQir Canada for check in, they told me I could not board the flight because I did not have a visa. I told them I did not intend to stay in Canada but just transit and usually the transit visa is given at the airport or online. However, the staff told me that as a Nepal citizen I could only get the visa if I go to the consulate in New York and do the necessary paperwork. Worried I decided to contact the Turkish airlines customer service. I called about 20 times with no avail. The call kept going to an automatic response. Really worried I decided to go to terminal E to meet the Turkish airlines staff in person. To my surprise, no one was there. I contacted the help desk and they told me that the Turkish airlines staff will be there only after 7 pm but my flight was to leave at 5 pm. Desperately looking for options, I went around the airport talking to every staff I came across, explaining my situation and they all told me only the (non-existent) Turkish staff could help me. Fast forward to 7 pm, (already forced to meet miss my actual flight) I finally meet the ticketing staff of Turkish airlines. I explained her my situation and tell her how I am a student planning to go home and I have already brought a connecting domestic flight back in Nepal to go from Kathmandu to home and that if I did not make this flight I would lose that ticket too. Then all she does is to tell me that I should have known that Canada requires a visa and that it is my fault. Stunned at her response, I tried to reason with her about how it is unreasonable to expect the customer to know this beforehand and that it is the airlines responsibility to let the customer know of such peculiar cases. After discussing for several minutes, she tells me that there is another flight leaving directly from Boston to Istanbul and that there is only one seat left and it will cost me USD 691 to transfer to this flight. Also she told me that if I had called the customer service immediately after this happened and changed the flight, I would not have had to pay the fine. (which is odd because my customer service call was never answered). I felt betrayed and sad at how the people who are supposed to help you make your life miserable. Although the hospitality of the staff in the plane was good, I felt deeply unsatisfied because of what I had to go through. This is easily the worst travel experience of my life yet.",Detractor
" The ground staff were very nice and polite. However, the flight was slightly delayed and for 35 wheelchair passengers there were only 5 people to push them, slowing the boarding process even more at Pearson. The lines were chaos during boarding at Pearson. People did not even stay in systematic lines and they were just ""hogging"" to board like a crowd and the ground staff didn't do anything about it. But thankfully they could announce star alliance gold and business passengers first. At least I could get a lot of space to put my bag. The inflight service was excellent. Excellent selection of movies for a 10 hour flight to Istanbul, delicious and well-presented food, clean bathrooms and prompt staff. When my inflight entertainment system froze during the flight, a flight crew promptly responded and fixed it. Same with when I asked for tea mid-flight. However, the wifi was really bad, it didn't work at all. The cabin crew were very friendly. The same applies with the connecting inflight service till Mumbai. However, the boarding was a lot better at Istanbul, as we could thankfully board from the aerobridge than the bus.

" Dusseldorf to Mumbai via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines used to be a premium airline for economy passengers. However, over the years they have just become horrible. I was flying from Dusseldorf to Mumbai, they cancelled the first leg of my ticket from Dusseldorf to Istanbul without my consent or without informing me. I spent 9 hours and heaven knows how much money in calling up their customer service before the day of the journey in getting this sorted and getting the ticket re-issued. The in-flight services were very poor, poor in-flight entertainment, cabin crew was rude and food was awful (on one of my 4 flights they served only meal which was non-veg and insisted that one has to pre-book ""special meals""). Any international flight has and should have at least two choices of meals - veg and non-veg. I am surprised how fast this airline has deteriorated after being a great one for a few years.

" Los Angeles to Tehran via Istanbul. Unfortunately this airline is getting worse and worse by the day. They used to be good in service and food. They served us cold and tasteless food although they have 1-2 chefs walking around. Their seats are narrow, cramped and very uncomfortable. If the passenger in front of you recline his/her seat, you can't use the tray in front of you. The space is too cramped. The bathrooms are filthy after a few hours and it is not really the flight attendants job to clean the bathrooms while serving the food with the same gloves. The flights from Istanbul to Tehran in both directions were terrible. The flight attendants were condescending to the fellow passengers. It wasn't just this trip. It is also the only airline flying to US has the longest immigration checkpoints before boarding the plane. 3 people checks your passport and 1 checks your carry-on. Everyone gets checked.",Detractor
 Istanbul to Lisbon. My family and I arrived 3 hours before the flight in order to check in and deliver our luggage. The assistant at the desk told us we couldn't get seats and his only explanation was â€˜this flight is horrible' and refused to give any further explanation. He gave us â€˜standby' boarding passes. At the boarding gate we were put aside and made wait for everyone else to get on board. There were 7 people in our situation and among them a pregnant lady that was treated with absolutely no respect! Since there was no one giving up the flight we had to stay and fly on the next day because we were sold tickets that didn't exist. We had bought this reservation for more than a month before the flight and suddenly they tell us there is no place for us? A Company has to make sure everyone is seated and flies at the time and date they reserved. Overbooking generates a lot of serious consequences.,Detractor

They end up giving me a middle seat, very narrow cramped seat between two athletic gentlemen that I could not move for 14 hours.

The planes on all 4 legs return was old and worn (don't know the type), old and smelly blankets, the food was by far not what it used to be, uncomfortable seats, totally unorganized transit lanes through customs, which nearly caused me to miss the onward flight.

" I recently flew Turkish Airlines (to/from South Africa via Istanbul), and upon boarding my return flight Johannesburg to Houston via Istanbul and due to their gate security not recognizing my paperwork, I was denied entry onto my flight. Okay, so besides legalities as far as letting me on board even though USCIS confirmed my correct paperwork and Turkish Airlines refused to let me speak to a supervisor. I was treated horrifically, both by their ground staff and corporate office. No one knew who the hell to speak to as far as how their own offices, gates, officers etc worked. I was told I would be taken to the Turkish Airlines Lounge where I would have a computer and phone I could use and gather my thoughts and help, no. I was taken from one gate to the next for several hours, then taken in by security and held there for the next several hours. I was then told I had to go to the denied office and I would be assisted there, to which no assistance was available. They literally said when I asked if they knew who I could contact, â€œthere is a phone and computer, google your help.â€ I arrived at 5am, and left the airport that evening at 10:45pm after no help from Turkish Airlines. When I asked instead of being held here in Turkey if they would fly me back to South Africa they said no. I tried to ask about booking a flight to Germany where my other citizenship is, and they told me they would not let me because my end destination was in the United States. I then worked on trying to get accommodation close by, after being in the airport for a day and half, coffee shop for a day/night as I had no where to go and then finally find accommodation. Finally when gathering my paperwork, Turkish airlines then refused to even honor the ticket they denied me entrance on, so I had to find an extra $600, post $575 I had paid to get an interview with the Embassy, and accommodation costs, as a part-time student, they simply emailed me with the audacity of speaking to me like an incompetent person.

Next the international transfer security check was overwhelmed with passengers.

" Taipei via Istanbul to Bremen with Turkish Airlines. It was probably the worst flight experience I had. The flight was supposed to leave late at night and the staff kept delaying it due to a technical reason in half an hour steps until about 4 am (6 hours late). I talked to a woman who flew the same route to Bremen and got upgraded to business class. Due to the delay I missed my connection in Istanbul and had to deal with the rudest customer service who wanted to give me a flight the next day (which was already my birthday that I tried to get home for in time) after lining up with several other passengers even though the airline knew for 15 hours that I would not be able to make my connecting flight. Only after arguing and looking up different options myself they booked me on a different flight to Bremen via Frankfurt. The rest of the waiting time in Istanbul i just felt terrible because no one should be mistreated by such customer service after the airline messed up on several ends already. But it gets worse! After finally arriving at Bremen airport with a total delay of 10 hours the airline confirmed that their customer service can be even worse. I wrote a feedback about my whole trip and how bad their staff handled the situation and asked why some passengers get a business class upgrade and some don't. I also applied to the passenger rights posted on their website where in my case they offered 600â‚¬ compensation. I cannot tell the emails in detail but it went on for 3 months and they just kept trying to find excuses. First of all they claimed that the delay has been beyond their control. At the gate it said the delay was due to technical reason (I even sent a picture as proof) which is not beyond an airlines control. About the rude customer service and delay policy they didn't really say anything besides offering to pay for my coffee in Istanbul. This confirmed to me that they just don't care about their customers. And finally, they said there has been no passenger upgraded on the flight. These are just some parts of the argument I had with Turkish airlines over the last three months. They don't stick to their promises and they have no interest in providing you a good travel experience. They don't even stick to their compensation policy posted on their website. Things can go wrong, that's just how it is. But how Turkish Airlines handles a situation like this really shows what you get with this airline. I thought never again but had one more flight with them from Bremen to Cairo via Istanbul in April. The flight got cancelled after boarding the plane and I arrived in Istanbul 9 hours late. Then planned sightseeing tour couldn't be done anymore and the hotel was booked for nothing. As I already expected, I had to deal with Turkish Airlines ground staff in Istanbul again.

" Beijing to Istanbul. TK uses a third party to handle their ground formalities in Beijing and need to be aware of the terribly rude and substandard service by check-in and gate agents. My check-in was processed by an agent who was abrupt and surly who conversed with a colleague throughout the check-in process. At the gate we were told there was a 30 minute delay although none of the monitors showed it. As with most departures in China boarding was chaotic with priority lanes being used by all passengers. The flight took off 2.5 hours late despite the gate agents insistence that the delay was only for 30 minutes. On board the crew were friendly and professional. The seat was OK in upright position but uncomfortable in lie flat position due to worn out cushion. Food was tasty but the wine list is in need of a refresh as they have been serving the same selection for 2 years. IFE has a good selection but I opted for sleep given the very late departure time. Lavatories were in decent shape but the sink could have used a bit more attention. Due to late departure, the flight landed late resulting in many missed connections. Although the delay was not really the airline's fault as Beijing was having a late winter snowfall, the communications around it were totally misleading. For instance the captain referred to de-icing being completed in 5 minutes' time when no de-icing equipment were in sight. Overall it was a mediocre to OK flight.",Passive

" Boston to Tehran via Istanbul. I had one of my worst experience (if not the worst) with Turkish Airlines. I would be a couple pages if I write exactly how many mistakes their agents made and how I got ripped off because of their mistakes! When I first checked in my bag the agent couldn't find my second flight so didn't issue me the boarding pass for that flight and told me I should get boarding pass when I arrive in Istanbul. She first said I should claim my bag in Istanbul and then changed it and said I should claim it in my final destination. In Istanbul, I was told by an agent to wait in a line for boarding pass and when I reached front desk the person there said she couldn't find my ticket! Again, after I showed my online booking she said that because my flight is from the other airport I should go there and get my boarding pass! I then rushed to the other airport which is around 1-2 hours drive far (because I waited around 3 hours in that line to get my boarding pass!!) only to find out that my bag was left at the previous airport that I arrived! So I missed my flight, had to pay to reschedule fee, and had to go back to the previous airport to claim my bag. I told them that I don't want to reschedule with them and she said if I don't I basically forfeit my return flight! So, I had to pay a fee that was about 10 times higher than a single other flight that I could book at the same time with another airline! Back in the first airline, also I had so hard time to find my bag! Noone at this airlines knows what they are doing apparently. It's totally crazy. When I claimed my bag it was obvious that they made a mistake. They ripped off a part of it and wrote the destination by hand (took pictures of that as well to file a complaint). Not to mention that I got ripped off also by the airport taxi for 20 times of what I should have paid them (as I was in a hurry and didn't know the exchange rate and wanted not to miss my other flight although I had already missed it as my bag was not there). This is one of the worst and incompetent airlines that I traveled with. The only scenario that I can think of that you will have a pleasant flight is if nothing and absolutely nothing wrong or just a bit uncommon happens. Nobody knows what they are doing and it's surprising. Even when I wanted to find my bag at the previous airport when I went there, I talked to at least 5 Turkish Airlines agent about it and everyone was sending me to a different direction and was saying a different thing.

" New York to Tel Aviv via Istanbul was on time, as were 4 segments of my itinerary. Cabin staff solicitous ,helpful and polite. Catering out of JFK was particularly good, the onboard ""chefs"" a nice touch even if they really aren't preparing much fresh food. We were seated on the side, 2 abreast, which was good as the center section of 3 across does not look appealing. The seats are relatively open, not affording much privacy, but the amount of storage is more than very sufficient, and the seat comfort when in the flat position, including the ""bedpad"", comforter and pillow more than adequate. The lounge in Istanbul was quite good, being on two levels with many interesting and well prepared food stations. We were also given two private sleeping rooms in the lounge for our 5 hour transit, a very nice touch.

" Mauritius to Dublin via Istanbul. I have flown Turkish Airlines a few times now in business. The business seats are side by side lie flats and not the more modern individual spaces found on most long-haul airlines. So, privacy is an issue. The chef in my opinion not a professionally trained chef but more a steward. The idea is a not a bad one as it gives the impression of a more dedicated service. However, the food is quite poor, and the drinks offered not a large selection. The staff were all very pleasant to me. Arriving at IST the business lounge, supposedly the best in the world, was closing. I arrived at 12.10 and the girl told me they were closed.

Their website is a mess, their mobile site a disaster and their customer service appalling. They destroyed my new bag. I got the replacement quote and they offered me half. Why should they ask me to pay half towards a bag they wrecked? This has changed my attitude towards Turkish and they are not my chosen airline any longer.",Detractor
" Flew from Izmir to Bangkok via Istanbul and return on same route. Food was excellent, service was very good. Especially male crew on both flights, they were very friendly and willing to do everything as perfect as possible. Heard them speaking with other customers with good English skills. Entertainment with lots of choice. Very comfortable seats which can be changed to a bed with one button or to different positions and I slept well on the long flights. The lounge in Istanbul is amazing and also The Eva Air lounge in Bangkok that Turkish Airlines passengers can use was very classy. I enjoyed eating in both of them. Overall I can recommend Turkish Airlines Business class. It was a pleasure. The only small minus was on the Turkey legs I didn't feel acknowledged during boarding being a business class passenger.",Promoter
" Berlin to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. Check in at TXL was smooth. We were bussed to a A330 for the first leg to IST. The IFE screens were not working for half of the seats in the main cabin. Also not during the safety instructions and I was shocked to see that the cabin crew did not ensure passengers were given a demonstration instead or checked if seat belts were fastened and specific rows were cleared of hand luggage. The crew could also learn a bit more English and be a bit friendlier overall. IST-KUL was on a Boeing 777 and certainly more comfortable. The crew was more present, is TK a hit or miss? The IFE is great (when it works) and they certainly serve excellent food! IST is a nightmare but that's another review.",Promoter
" Mumbai to Houston via Istanbul. My bag was misplaced/lost by Turkish Airlines and it took more than one month to get my bag. The airline was not even interested in contacting me or updating me. I repeatedly explained to them that more than anything else, my important medications which I needed to take on a daily basis were in the bag. Fortunately, some of the medications, which my husband had in his possession, were couriered to me from New York. To cut a long story short, finally after my bag reached its destination, instead of the airline delivering the bag, I had to collect it from La Guardia airport. Turkish Airlines boasts of being the best airline in Europe but I do not agree to this. I am sure there are more passengers who must have faced similar problems that I went through.",Passive
" Don't be fooled by good food and new aircraft. Only when you face a problem you can see the quality of services. And I (Business class traveller and Elite Gold member) have a very long list of stories of very poor services. 1) 8 days today and I am without my only checked in bag during my flight to Houston and Turkish Airlines simply not doing anything except sending a message every few days saying they are investigating. I have no clothes for 8 days and Turkish Airlines are refusing even to compensate me for the lost bag. 2) When we changed our travel date due to a medical emergency supported by a letter from the hospital, Turkish Airlines charged me and my wife 1200 extra dollars per ticket and refused to waive any fees due to the medical emergency like all other reputable airlines. 3) On a number of occasions I missed my connections due to late arrival to Istanbul (on Turkish Airlines) and Turkish Airlines refused to take any resposibility for missing my meetings by flying me on a different airlines flight. This is happening to business class travellers, imagine if you fly economy. Very poor Airline.",Detractor
" Moscow to Manila via Istanbul. Good flight from Moscow to Istanbul. Comfortable seats with reasonable recline. Flight left and landed on time. Cabin staff functioned well with announcements in Turkish, Russian and English. A good lunch was served with appropriate sized portions. IFE had a fair selection of films available. Istanbul to Manila a fair flight. Dinner was served at the beginning of the flight and chef did not present any alternatives when the main course that I wanted was not available so I slept and woke up relatively early. I had an early breakfast (this was quite adequate, although I would have liked a little more given no dinner the previous night). No further food was offered. I think that the airline would be better off allowing passengers going straight to sleep and then having breakfast and lunch as the two meals on this long flight. Overall the quality of the service from Istanbul to Manila was a little lower than previous long haul flights in business class.",Promoter
 Istanbul to Tel Aviv return. Ground staff very helpful in boarding the flight. Both flights left and arrived on time. The planes were clean and modern and the flights uneventful.

On the return flight the check in worked well. I was given priority because I was transferring to Business Class for the second leg.

" Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. My nightmare started when I missed my connecting flight from Istanbul going to Dubai. I was sent from one person to another there after and subsequently had a buy a visa ($30) at the airport in other to get to their ticket counter. At the ticket counter, the guy at the booth told me I had to pay $600 penalty for missing my flight and then another $2000 for a new ticket because I bought my ticket from an agent. There was no talking to him after that as he dismissed me when I told him there was no way I could pay him $2600. With the help of a very kind gentleman at the airport, I purchased another ticket to Dubai with Air Arabia. I had to leave Ataturk airport via taxi ($60) to another airport called Sabiha to catch the flight to get to Sharjah International and then subsequently to Dubai. When I went online to check, I was told my return was valid and secured and I even called the customer service line twice and was informed that I was checked in for my return. I was able to check in online and even change my seat for the return flight. I arrived at DXB airport at 4am February 22nd morning, waited for the check in counter to open at 5:20am to check in, only to be told by the agent at the desk that I could not fly out with them. He told me that since I broke the sequence and did not pay the $2600 in Turkey, my ticket was no longer valid. He also told me that they had neither a customer service counter nor a ticket counter in Dubai so my only option was to call the same customer service that previously assured me that I was confirmed to fly back to Houston with their airline. I had to be back in Houston so I had no choice but to purchase another ticket with Emirates. I had to take a shuttle to terminal 3, bought a one way business class ticket for $5440 just to make it back to Houston. Telling a passenger to pay $2600 for missing a connection is unconscionable. The staff are rude and inhumane, Ataturk airport is chaotic and Turkish Airlines does not care about its passengers regardless of if you're flying business class or economy.",Detractor
" Houston to Istanbul. Very poor staff interaction, in both the aircraft and Istanbul airport, it's quite unenjoyable to be in such hostile environment.

I believe they used to be the best airlines in Europe, now I am confident to say they are the worst in Europe.",Detractor
 London to Istanbul. I am a frequent flyer who always travels with excess baggage up to 10 times a year internationally. As a result of the ultra punitive charges for excess baggage on the low cost carriers like Ryanair and EasyJet I prefer to travel with the normal carriers and was very keen to try Turkish Airlines as they have a good reputation and being a gold Emirates flyer I wanted to check the experience. How sad that they have such a horrific extra baggage policy. After battling to find anything on there site after booking my ticket I presumed that I would pay per piece and saw that there looked to be an $80 price on some flights. As I had already paid and unable to navigate there confusing baggage policy on line and unable to pay on line either I made my way to the airport. My ticket cost me approx Â£120 I went with 1 extra bag weighing exactly 23kg. I know how strict airlines are about this. I was horrified to be charged approx Â£230 for my extra bag. Â£110 more than my ticket and resulted in an increase in my costs by over 200%. I could have bought 2 extra tickets. How can this be justified? I immediately realized why there extra luggage policy on there website is difficult to navigate. Extra profits. Ryanair and Easyjet get such a bad rap for these sort of charges and they are open and upfront about them. To get stung with these at the airport and have them being double the cost of a ticket is truly blackmailing your customers. I learnt my lesson and will never travel this airline. Companies that force unjustified charges on unsuspecting customers should be held to account. Why is it so much? How can one bag cost double a ticket price? Shame on them.,Detractor

" Istanbul to Guangzhou. One of the nicer things about Turkish Airlines is the free possibility to reserve a flight for a couple of days before booking it. We did, because we had our 3 month old daughter with us and desperately wanted her to be able to sleep in a baby bassinet and were ready to book any airline that could offer that. After reserving the flight we contacted Turkish Airlines helpdesk on Twitter (@TK_HelpDesk) to ask if they could reserve a bassinet for us and confirmed the ticket and paid after we were assured that would not be a problem. All fell apart 40 days later when we actually got on the plane and there were no bassinet seats available and the plane looked like it was fully booked. The crew asked a couple of people of they would want to change, but all refused. Later we learned they paid extra for the seats with the bassinets. A 10 hour night flight turned into a sleepless horror story trying to keep the baby balanced on our laps for hours. The space was so limited we had no possibility to eat a thing and without any possibility for air to flow things got really sweaty. After recovery at home we contacted the complaints department and quickly learned that they were only there for empty apologies. Turkish Airlines apparently decided to start selling the seats with the bassinets and decided not to bother with any of its previous commitments, just deleted them all without message or warning. Kind of baffled I inquired a few times again but somehow this multi-billion company kept insisting that breaching the contract with their customers was business as usual for them. Can't really do anything else then to warn as many people as possible not to trust this airline.",Detractor
" Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The first time I flew with Turkish Airlines and it was a disappointment. My flight from Manchester to Istanbul was delayed for an hour as some of the passengers could not follow simple instructions ie. seating at their assigned seats. This caused ruckus as some of them insisted on sitting on other people's seats which I found utterly ridiculous. The staff handled this poorly and kept shouting at everyone. The seat has narrow legroom and was uncomfortable. Even though it was a 4 hour flight to Istanbul, the plane was small and does not offer much space. There is only 2 toilets for economy class passengers and with people lining up to use the bathroom and staff trying to serve meals with the trolley, it was not a nice experiencel. The staff's English proficiency has room for improvement as I could not understand much from the announcements made and at one point I was given tomato juice after asking for mango juice. The in-flight meals and entertainment are satisfactory. I was lucky as even though the first flight was delayed for an hour, I managed to continue with the second flight to Kuala Lumpur. I however was not happy about the transit as the gate for my connecting flight was really far and then I had to ride the bus which took almost half an hour to reach the plane and was left to wait in the bus with the doors open (which was not a good idea as it was cold and windy early that morning) for another 15-20 mins before we were allowed to enter the plane. In conclusion, this was really a bad experience.",Detractor

" Tel Aviv to New York via Istanbul. Awful service on the Ground We had a family vacation, using Turkish airlines from Tel Aviv to JFK and then connecting with Copa. I won't comment on the flight or the service in the air, they were both great. But I was surprised at the ineptitude and lack of communication abilities of the ground crew, both in the Istanbul Lounge, and in the JFK transfer desk. My wife had the beginning of a cold on the plane and the eair pain was almost unbearable. Went to the Concierge at the Lounge to get some Ear Medicine, and they couldn't understand us. They sent us to the reception. Reception called the airport pharmacy, but couldn't manage to let them know what we needed. We waited for an hour for a pharmacist to show, and the liunge didn't care either way. They even complained that we should be grateful they were doing us a favor. Very dissapointed. But at JFK, it was even worse! We arrived after an 11 hour flight and had 6 hours to connect to Panama. We picked up our 8 large bags and 3 carryons, we go to the airline interline bag counter. The clueless agent they had, told us that they couldn't accept the bags. That Turkish only had an alliance with JetBlue and with United, not with Copa. We told her that our bags had been ticketed from Tel Aviv to Copa with a Turkish airlines bag locator, and she still ignored it. She insisted there was no alliance between Turkish and Copa. We explained they were both Star Alliance, and it was like she didn't know what that meant. A supervisor didn't want to come down to the desk, and said we had to go to Copa. The agent wouldn't even call the Copa desk to see if they were open. After 20 minutes arguing, we had to get 3 baggage carts, take the Airtrain to terminal 4, to find out the Copa counter wouldn't open for 3 more hors. We had to wait with the bags for 3 hours, having a bite to eat at a dinner. All because of Turkish Airlines incompetence, because obviously when we explained to the Copa supervisor what happened, they said Turkish should've accepted the bags.

Connecting in Istanbul was OK, very crowded and gate logistics not very efficient, but understandable due to the small terminal from where we were shuttled to the plane with a bus. We did not check our bags and the staff were vocal on giving priority to overhead compartment for larger bags which suited us perfectly, this is something other airlines should think of.

" Stockholm to Istanbul. Fast and friendly check-in agent. Time for a visit to the modest SAS Lounge (being Star Gold status) where there was a selection of light bites and drinks perfectly adequate for a pre-flight snack. Orderly boarding with priority boarding well handled. Inside the aircraft I first noticed the small size of the individual seat-back screens. But obviously airlines can't just throw them all away when bigger and better ones come along. Hot meal served in flight - with a choice of two entrees and various drinks. Delay landing in Istanbul due to congestion - hopefully a thing of the past when the new airport opens. Bus to the terminal. Long queue for the Biz class immigration desk. To the right of it is a channel serving a continual line of Turkish Airlines crew. I don't understand why the crew dont use the two adjacent but always empty Beogs electronic immigration gates, hence freeing up a second line for the high revenue fare paying passengers. Even after the queue there was a wait for the luggage to come up. Overall a good flight and thanks to the fare I found online, extremely good value. Even if I didn't earn many â€œmilesâ€.",Promoter

" At half the price for a return trip from Heathrow to Cape Town with other airlines, Turkish Airlines' business class offering was too tempting to pass by, even if there was the inconvenience of transiting via Istanbul Take-off for LHR to IST was delayed by an hour, which was a concern given that we had just 1 hr 40 minutes between the scheduled landing and take-off for the IST-CPT leg. Having the full flat-bed experience for a short-haul flight was a real luxury and Turkish Airlines win hands down for providing this. Food on board was adequate and of the standard that BA now provide in Club Europe. Wheeling a trolley around loaded with foil-topped main courses didn't seem the best way of using the sky chef on board. Landing at IST was delayed by congestion and we'd almost given up on making the next flight. Getting to the terminal was helped by the airline providing a separate bus for business class. Details of gates for transit passengers was helpfully provided on board. IST is unbelievably chaotic, even at 1:00 am, but staff were around to direct passengers, and it was then just a matter of a frantic dash to the gate. Amazingly, we arrived just in time for boarding, but there was then another wait for the bus to fill to take us to a far stand. The food service on the IST-CPT leg was astonishingly good, and the role of sky chef was much more in evidence, with individual plating up of all the courses and a trolley circulated with desserts. A breakfast menu was also offered just after boarding, which allowed us to choose as much or as little as we wanted. Even the scrambled eggs were good! Disembarkation at CPT was quick, immigration was a breeze and we collected our bags just 10 minutes after landing.

After complaining to manager, we were offered an accommodation in an outside hotel (we would need to procure visa and arrange transportation). Before our departure from Canada I inquired by phone if we can reserve the sleeping space because of our long wait and was told that is on first come first served and no mention of the rule. Would we know that there was the stupid rule we would have reserved a hotel room within the airport. On our arrival in Istanbul it was of course fully booked.

" Amsterdam to New York via Istanbul. Have always been satisfied with Turkish Airlines: good service, good food, good prices. However there was a snafu on this trip. I'd booked an overnight connexion in Istanbul because the fare was $100 less than the other carriers. My hotel was $50, so it was still a savings. However, I checked TIMATIC for visa requirements on a star alliance site and it said no visa required, but I had to pay $30 at the airport to leave to go to my hotel. So, it turned out to be a false economy. Check-in service at both AMS and IST were top-notch: I had a connexion at JFK to Jet blue to Albuquerque and was very happy that TK interlined my bag to them. US carriers have stopped doing that an American Airlines doesn't even transfer bags to their own flights anymore (if booked on a separate record, which is how you issue two tickets since it has become a self-service world).

I was bit disappointed with the special meal as they have been serving the same food for more than a year now. Starter was great so was the main course. I am surprised to see that they have cut down on dessert. I had some desserts and they were delicious. The cabin was very quiet and could catch some sleep. Pre landing hot meal was also delicious. The best part of the whole flight was the crew who worked very hard to ensure each passenger was happy. In short TK has excellent product, catering is very healthy and plenty to choose from.

Completely switched back to Turkish, which slowly upgraded economy product over last few years.",Promoter
" Flew Istanbul to New York City with Turkish Airlines. Very tasty Turkish food, on time departure, polite crew members and last but not least, a great entertainment system with the lastest movies. I dont understand how this airline scores less than 8 on this website. Seats were comfortable and wide. I had a very pleasant flight with Turkish compared to other major airline companies and would recommend it to anyone.",Promoter
 Istanbul to Marseille. I usually fly Turkish Airoines at least 4 times a year. I've never honestly had anything to complain about. Their airport is good their staff are active and their planes are comfortable and safe. It's an airline that I trust and provides all the quality I can ask for.,Promoter
" Turkish Airlines are good but not a 5 star airline yet. Food was ok, better on short haul than long haul. Seating was good. Candlelight dinner was a clever idea, but wine choice was very poor, 2-3-2 seating in business is not good, especially the middle seat. Amenities pack was poor, Bentley and Furla. The downsides to me were the zoning of seats it was a free for all. Some staff were rude MIA to IST, asking if my wife was in the right seat? Stop economy passengers walking into business to use the restrooms, this was common to all flights. The in flight entertainment did not work in row 5, it was a full flight, so to be without for 12 hours was a nightmare, staff just shrugged shoulders. Case arrived broken in Munich - Delsey Hard Case, that was wrapped so did not see until unpacking. So would I use again, well 70% as price was keen.",Passive
" Ä°stanbul to Antalya. Check-in and boarding smooth. Plane was clean and seats were comfortable. Staff was polite enough. About 20 minutes after the take off, they served a sandwich and a cup of drink that you chose from given options. Though I think food should sold with a separate option instead of being included to every ticket, it was delicious so no complaints there. Overall everything was good. I had bad experiences with Turkish Airlines but this time I am satisfied.",Promoter
" My family and I flew from Washington via Islamabad and return from Karachi - Istanbul - Washington in December on Turkish Airlines and couldn't have been more pleased. The flights were on time, inflight catering was excellent, the leg space in economy has slightly improved, the English proficiency of the crew has greatly improved, and the inflight entertainment has vastly improved and is easy to use. The service of the crew was excellent. My mother in law who was traveling with us can only consume liquids and requested if she could could get some milk to drink. Instead the crew brought her soup from business class and then came back a little bit later with some more. Truly above and beyond service on their part. The only thing though is the USB ports did not fully work in all of the seats which was annoying, and I wish they did not do away with the delicious Turkish food which used to be served. But all in all Turkish Airlines is worth every penny, and I do not regret choosing them back in 2007 as my international airline of choice.",Promoter
" Munich to Tehran via Istanbul SAW. I had a suitcase and a carry on. As the carry on exceeded the 8 kilos permitted cabin weight, I paid the extra fee and checked in the carry on as well. However, when landed in Tehran, I realized that the carry on's tagging number was not even issued at the boarding desk and my carry on was lost. I filled in the application form at lost and found office in Tehran and have called the Turkish airlines at Munich airport several times so far, but after 10 days still haven't received any answer. As I do not even have a baggage tag number for my carry on, I cannot even claim for compensation. What I am wondering is, even if the check-in clerk forgets to hand over the baggage tag, why can't they try to check what was the number of the checked in carry-on as all the information are recorded and kept in the system. I am extremely disappointed as this has kind of ruined my holiday.",Detractor
" Boston to Istanbul. Worst service I have experienced. Not only did I have to keep asking for utensils and missing food items on my tray but when I asked for a drink he gave e me a tiny cup and poured it half way with a coca-cola beverage.

I was not given a seat for free, I paid for it.",Detractor
" It was my first time flying Turkish Airlines from Geneva to Jakarta via Istanbul. I picked them because the schedule was convenient, and they were a bit cheaper than Emirates. The first leg was fine, nothing special, but not much to comment or criticize. The service was acceptable, and the food actually pretty good. Transit in Istanbul: disembarked in the rain, had to take the bus from a remote parking spot, same thing outbound, got a bit wet both times. Ataturk is not a great airport to say the least, and is one of the reasons I would not pick Turkish Airlines for first choice: facilities below average, security is a bit of a jungle, the gate was way too far from the lounge, the boarding was a single line (everyone mixed), too many people cramped in the bus. I was tired, had come out of a sleepless night, and going for a second one, so all this extra stress and exercise was not welcome at all. I had bought a business class ticket, just to prevent being too tired! The second leg was less impressive than the first one, the cabin service was below average for business, the staff were trying, but were missing something. I slept through dinner, but the arrival snack was disappointing (scrambled eggs at 4.00 pm! Or a Turkish pastry that the staff don't even bother explaining what it is, so I passed. I had a hard time having a tea served the way I wanted, so I gave up on it. The seat was acceptable, and the entertainment system good (some other airlines have more choices, but it was good enough for me), I liked the controlller than can be used as a screen, and the headsets. I could have taken Emirates for $500 more.",Passive
" I was travelling back from Istanbul to Toronto with Turkish Airlines. The ground staff were so rude at airport and flight crew were worse. Since our flight was delayed by an hour or so, we couldn't get a ramp, so we waited for the buses to come so that they can bring passengers to the Terminal. I was traveling with a wheelchair, was sitting in the middle of the plane. After all the passengers got off the plane, they starts the wheelchair passengers. First they moved us all to the front of the plane then said that we're getting off the back door. We waited another 30 mins to get off.",Detractor

" Medina to Lahore via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines service is one of the poorest. I and my wife were made to sit at the airport during a 14 hours stopover at IST on 4th December. To add insult to injury, 2 of 3 baggage pieces remain missing to date. Our transit time at IST was around 14 hrs. When approached the service counter at Istanbul they gave us only one snack (one slice of pizza for each passenger) voucher. I asked her where to stay for full day transit. She said anywhere at the airport and went back to her mobile phone chat. In between, she was chatting with a male colleague and didn't seem to have time to pay attention to customer. She worked more like a machine than a human in only giving vouchers with out speaking to customers. Upon complaint they tried to cover its inefficiency and poor service by saying that â€œNo request can be traced at their hotel desk on ISTâ€. How will there be a record if TK staff misleads the customers away. Nobody (TK ticket sales office at Lahore airport) had informed us the time of ticketing to request a hotel in advance during transit at IST. TK said that we didn't request a hotel.",Detractor

Talked to at least 15 different agents on the phone to fix one thing - to change the airport of departure, and to deal with the problems that they created because of this. Always redirect to another agent on the phone, and no-one takes responsibility and doesn't provide any solution.

On putting in the claim I was told I would get my bags the following day, again only to call and find out only 1 bag arrived and the other bag is still in Mombasa.

Turkish airlines said, we cannot do anything about it, because you arrived 6:03 am from Male, and to Vilnius our flight is 4:00 p.m. They said it is not enough hours because they provide hotel only when it is 10 hours waiting.

In Istanbul 3 different employees of Turkish tried to convince me that that was the correct one and no change could be done, despite the fact earlier flights were available. Customer service was unwelcoming, poor and inefficient. Istanbul airport is small, dirty and congested. They sell lower cost tickets, just because you have to wait for up to 10 hours in the airport. Be prepared to be misstreated. It seems that rudness is a part of Turkish Airline culture.",Detractor
" Turkish Airlines in the last few years have been a formidable competitor to European long haul carriers. And quite rightly so. Not only are their prices extremely competitive, book early and you could be in for a bargain. This was my first long haul flight with them, and it will not be my last. They operate on A330 with 2x2x2 and Boeing 777 with a 2x3x2 layout. While the seating configuration was as expected, it's the service that made all the difference. Once on board, they have a rather novel safety video, which is both informative and amusing. The 'onboard chef' is a nice added touch, although it's not like he's going to prepare the meal in front of you. The flight attendants were extremely polite and friendly, regularly checking up on you if you needed anything. The dining was great. With a mini 'candlelight' to compliment the food table, to a delicious selection of appetisers and sweet trolley, the service was excellent without being rushed. The amenity kits were rather basic. The IFE was good on the outbound A330 and 777. With some nice wine, cognac and coffee later, the bed was prepared for me and tucked myself in for a good 3 hours sleep. The outbound flight to Hanoi was near perfection. The flight from Hanoi to Istanbul was a slight disappointment. I first noticed the A330 had the old livery on it. When entering, the cabin looked older, there was no storage space, other than overhead. The seats looked old and felt uncomfortable. The IFE, with the small handset was so difficult to use, even the cabin stall were trying to help others with it. The flight announcements were crackled and weren't clear. The toilet I used, although clean was old - the flush button was held together with duct tape! The flight from Istanbul to London on the 777 was a delight. This was a long haul business class experience on a short haul flight. The service and cabin staff were excellent, even on the old A330!",Promoter
" Having been on a few European flights so called 'Business Class', I was looking forward to the much praised Turkish Airlines Business Class flying from London to Istanbul. Turkish use widebody on most flights to Istanbul, and I was aware that this narrow body aircraft which I was flying in was not going to be as spacious. But the moment I stepped into the aircraft, I was welcomed with a warm smile and directed to my seat. This was a true Business Class seat (unlike the notorious tight 2x2 with empty middle seat deployed by other European airlines). The wide seat was extremely comfortable, with ample leg room, reading lamp and fold out IFE monitor. No sooner had I settled down, I was offered a selection of soft drinks followed by hot towel. 20 minutes into the flight I chose a traditional Turkish breakfast which included a selection of delicious appetizers, accompanied by Champagne (with refills). The flight attendants were efficient, chatty without being intrusive, and looked like they actually enjoyed serving the passengers. I fiddled about a little with the IFE, watched about half a movie, downing my coffee. Although not a great choice of films and programmes, it was perfectly adequate for a short journey. I enjoyed this flight very much and full marks to Turkish Airlines offering a good business class product on a short haul flight. If they decided to add WiFi on all aircraft, it might really annoy the competition.",Promoter

Seating slightly cramped in Economy but fine for 2Â½ hr flights and all seats equipped with IFE. TK seems to have kept their high quality in catering (Do & Co): full hot meals provided with drinks, very tasty meals. The cabin crews were hard working on both flights and the lady purser on TK1761 was a real star: very warm, friendly and extremely patient with the same unruly passengers who jumped up to the aisle every time the seat belt sign went on in heavy turbulence. Quite annoying but handled with care by the purser and the cabin crew on TK1761. Good quality and great value, will book again.",Promoter

" Flew business class, TK35 Istanbul to Montreal on Dec 08 2017. I must emphasize the amazing lounge in Istanbul. No wonder it was voted the best business class lounge in the world by Skytrax. We were a bit deceived though, not to be able to have a suite to relax, since our layover was 30 minutes above the 7 hours permitted as per regulations! At least we were able to use the showers after 2.5 hours on a waiting list. Best shower facilities we have ever seen in an airport business class lounge! Onboard, before take-off they offer a selection of newspapers and magazines but nothing in French! Isn't Turkish Airlines aware that Montreal is the second largest French metropolis in the world, after Paris? Just as an example, Lufthansa flies to Montreal out of Frankfurt and Munich, their safety announcements are in German, French with English subtitles. Being respectful about these issues goes a long way. Nevertheless, the crew were professional and quite nice. The business class cabin is quite impressive! Lot's of leg room, very comfortable seats, very large screens, quality headphones. I was able to sleep for 5 hours, which is out of the ordinary on board an aircraft for me. The food was ok, very well presented. We like these candlelight dinners which no other airlines offers to our knowledge. The negative side to this trip though is that we constantly had to beg for a glass of wine. We had just flown on Thai and Singapore and right after you sit down before take-off, they come to offer Champagne, water and juice. Not so with Turkish, they only offer a selection of 4 types of lemonade. When they take your meal order they ask if you want a glass of wine with your main course. No cocktail whatsoever before the meal is offered. If you dare ask for a glass of wine it is secretly poured behind a counter in front of the cabin. Normally with other airlines, they come to your seat and show you the bottle before they pour into your glass. You even have to tell them at some point to stop, because they offer constantly. Not so on Turkish!",Promoter
" Kayseri to Istanbul. I cannot recommend this airline. After being unable to fly to Turkey due to recent US Visa restrictions, I called the company. Was told to call back two weeks later which I did and then I was told to call back again. I did. Then I was told that I must get a refund at a Turkish Airlines sales office, there are only 2 in the entire US. I complained and was told to call back. Now I am told that I can get a ""refund"" after cancellation and ""no-show"" fees are applied. This amounted to $32 euros on a $600 ticket. Apparently, they are only granting full refunds if you depart from the US. This is an absolute sham and seems set up to make the system frustrating to navigate so they can mitigate their losses.

" Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul. My wife encountered a problem in Istanbul that involved an airport transit visa through Canada. It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: â€œReissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didn't see was the fine print at the bottom: â€œTurkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.â€. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didn't. I don't know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered â€œI can't accept thisâ€. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day. Turkish Airlines is different. This is truly a horrible company with mean spirited employees.",Detractor

Staffs at the airport were the rudest people I ever met. Even the visa officers at the counter didn't give me correct information instead they yelled and behaved in a very rude way. I couldn't get hotel because I and my kids had American passport and they don't issue visa from the airport to the American. My question to the Turkish Airlines is that why they didn't mention that while I brought the ticket why they issued ticket to the American passport?

" My first flights (Jakarta to Antalya via Istanbul). On the homebound flight from Antalya to Jakarta via Istanbul my TK 2425 (30 Nov 2017) was delayed without any announcement. On boarding I asked the ground crew if I would still be able to catch my Istanbul-Jakarta flight (TK56), and the ground crew replied that ""no problem"". The plane landed late and I missed my flight to Jakarta. Yes, Turkish airline did give me a hotel, yes, Turkish airline did give me a ticket rebooking, yes Turkish airline did give me breakfast-lunch-dinner. However, I did not receive my luggage and hence I did not have any change of clothes. Upon seeing the queue at the Turkish Airlines hotel transfer I was in a dilemma of either waiting another 2 hours before getting my luggage at 4am or go sleep at the hotel and not have my luggage. In my luggage was also my laptop charger and mobile charger which I would have needed to inform work, arrangements that I will be delayed by one day. But more scarily was my box of medicines that I needed. I was appalled by the ground crew at Antalya airport who lied to my face, and the ground crew at the hotel transfer who did not sympathize that I needed my luggage and only offered strict options. I was very dissapointed that Turkish airline did not provide me a letter of delay to help me justify my situation at my home country, and no laundry service hence I was not in fresh clothes for more than 48hrs!

" Being a loyal customer of this airline, I was once again dissapointed with Turkish Airlines completely messing up my flight. Outbound flight TK1856 from Barcelona to Istanbul left about 40 minutes delayed, and for that reason we were denied boarding for our connecting flight to Moscow, which resulted in spending an entire night at the airline's lounge. I would like to particularly stress the utter rudeness of the airline staff at the airport, who are completely uninterested in helping you out, pretending not to speak English and watching videos on their smartphones, giggling and discussing it with each other. While at the lounge, you are not allowed to use a shower since the previous flight was less than 8 hours long. So please know, if you miss your flight due to the airline's fault, you are on your own and no one really cares about your problem. That's a fact. The same situation happened to me in April, while returning from Miami to Moscow via Istanbul. The airline representative failed to change the dates for my wife and my infant child, changing it only for me, therefore, I ended up paying for the completely new tickets. Overpaid around 2000 USD. And, once again, the flight left late from Miami and, therefore, we missed the connecting flight and spent the night at the airport. We were not offered any hotel and we were also denied access to the lounge due to the mess up with the airline. The airline's feedback form is awful, and up to this day my issues with them had not been resolved. Even visiting the airline's office in Moscow does not help, everything is managed through the website. Overall, I am very disappointed with the airline and especially with their customer care. It's a shame, since their planes and prices are very nice, the headache in dealing with the problems afterwards is just too much to fly with them again.",Detractor

Prior to boarding, used the lounge which was operating at a lower pace than usual and the food choices were not as plentiful as they are during regular hours. Boarding was by zones but it was a total disappointment when I found out we were being bussed to the plane which made the use of zones completely redundant.

We were served breakfast then lunch prior to landing but the service was a tad on the slow side. I completed 8 return journeys across the Atlantic with Turkish in the last 12 months and their menu and wine selection have been the same each time and I believe a change is long overdue. The wifi worked well and the IFE had a decent selection although it could have used more recent movie releases. Flight departed and arrived on time and was a good experience overall.",Passive
"  London - Istanbul - Mashad in August and returned in September in economy. Three of us took the flights, planes were dated but they were clean and entertainment provided on board. Due to code sharing their flights were full to the limit. Lunch and dinner very good, however we did not like the breakfast. Mashhad to Istanbul delayed and as a result of this and due to very unhelpful airport staff (not Turkish Airlines) we missed our connecting flight and had to board the next flight, arriving in London 5 hours later than originally planned. Our bags delayed by about 5 days. All this to the side, Turkish Airlines processed our claim within 7 days, I had to only send a single email and full compensation was paid. Cabin crew were fantastic and ready to help. What I am most impressed with is their claim department that processed our claim very fast and paid full compensation. Well done to them and cabin crews.",Promoter
"  Frankfurt to Singapore via Istanbul. FRA-IST then 2.5h layover and IST-SIN. The check-in process was flawless. Turkish Airline personnel on the first leg of the trip was quite grumpy, but professional. Their airplanes are clean, the services offered (entertainment, catering) above average and their crew on the longer, second leg of my trip was fine as well. Unfortunately my new bag didn't arrive in Singapore. It's missing to this very day. The airport luggage handlers in Singapore created a lost baggage report form for me. They called me for four days, every day, to update me that my bag is not yet located. Then they stopped. Turkish Airline's website claims ""Within the first 5 days, the search for lost baggage is the responsibility of the airport Lost and Found Office. If your baggage is not found within the first 5 days, please visit the baggage irregularity report and follow-up page and make a claim with the required documents."". So I did that. I went to their website and made the claim. The website feels like it's 1990 again, limits text fields to something like 255 (not sure anymore) characters and disables copy and paste. It's as bad a website as I've ever seen one and will send you an English confirmation mail that links you to their Turkish website. I filed claims, stated my case, provided invoices and brands/prices for the things I am missing . Within minutes I received a reply. Unfortunately it didn't state a thing, was quite possibly a canned message and had vague content like ""On the other hand, if our research brings any negative result, then",Detractor
"  Atlanta to Nairobi via Istanbul. My experience begun with trying to book a reservation on the company portal on 4th November currently having a choice of 2 systems. Between dodging the prompt on whether you want to use â€œold versionâ€ or â€œnew versionâ€ I struggled to reserve a round trip from Atlanta to Nairobi 19th November 7, 2017 return 27th December 2017 only to discover minutes later when going to print off ticket that it was wrong! The information was captured inaccurately, I just had one way ticket that was outbound with my return date on it. Confident that this is an easy fix after years of travelling with other gulf region airlines, I immediately reach out to the Sales Office in Atlanta which rings endlessly without any answers. Very surprised but again in good faith reached out to the call center number provided. This was a nightmare, the first agent could barely speak English and any attempt to get the name was met with callous response of â€“ why are you calling. Speaking very slowly and clearly as it was obvious there was minimal comprehension, agent also confirming he could not understand leaving me very confused I patiently informed of the situation explaining that I was looking for a round trip ticket but believed there was a technical issue as screens kept switching between 2 versions on the portal. Eventually I was transferred to another department which I was informed would resolve the issue and unprofessionally transferred. I had to go through the same process. On the 6th when calling in for a status, as I tried to review the issue to the first agent, she told me she doesn't have to talk to me if I was calling for a status and I had to persist that she could not treat customers that way. This was the first time ever to attempt to use Turkish Airline and it is quite a rude shock. Eventually I was transferred to another department to an incoherent agent who sarcastically informed me that I could call back to speak to a more articulate agent. Not believing a corporation like this does not have people who could comprehend the issue, I made another attempt to call back and request to speak with a manager and explain that I needed a resolution with my primary goal is to get the correct ticket that I reserved as I still intended to take the trip. I persevered the same call process all over again and this time found an agent, more coherent and a little patient only for him to tell me they had emailed me a response and that my request was denied. When I sought for clarification or a manager he informed me that there are no managers there and he read a script out. This is very disturbing, there's no professional etiquette to this cycle of events even more so, my issue has not been addressed. It seems to be more about the money than customer satisfaction. My trip is about 50 hours away but I have the wrong ticket and no resolve. I have never experienced such a service in my many years of travel. I am hoping management will actually resolve the issue and not just respond without addressing the concern. I shudder at the thought of what lays ahead in the flight if this is the type of service they have before you even travel.",Detractor
"  Very good experience in total! Extremely good seats from Copenhagen to Istanbul. When entering the plane we saw that it was 2+2 seats with good space and an IFE even if it was only a 2.50 hr flight. Was served a simple meal which was enough. Had a layover of 3.15 hr in Istanbul and went to the lounge. From all reviews the lounge was highlighted as something positive. I would say the lounge needs a refresh. Worn seats, crowded, closed food places, etc.. Not at all what I had in my mind. You could of course drink unlimited liquor. Istanbul to Antananarivo was the best Business travel ever. Very responsive personnel and called you by name. The IFE had a good selection but the Denom headset was not noice cancelling! The boarding was chaotic. No organisation whatsoever.

"  Istanbul to London. My comment is really on the ground experience rather than the flight itself. There is no transport from the lounge to the gate for lesser abled people. All they offer is booking a wheelchair. How are you supposed to push somebody in a wheelchair while also carrying two handbags, a trolley and a guitar. Other airports/airlines have buggies at their disposal. Considering that some gates are 15 minutes walk, this is pretty poor. When flying from an apron gate (7xx e.g. 700), there are no business class buses for business class travelers and you're expected to stand in the bus for 20 minutes or so while it fills up until people step onto each others toes and everybody is squashed in. When questioning the ground staff on why there is no business class bus unlike like we were told at check-in, they said 'economics' and that business class buses are only available for incoming and domestic flights - very poor show. My overall rating of 6 explained: - on-board service & food: 8 - on-board cleanliness of toilets: 5 (floor's often wet) - lounge services & food: 8 - male lounge staff: 5 (often loud or shouting across the room) - female lounge staff: 9 - ground services (bus/transport): 0",Passive
"  Toronto to Tehran via Istanbul. This flight and airport was the worst travel experience we had. The flight from Toronto to Istanbul departed the Pearson Airport with one hour delay. There was very unusual turbulence, almost through more than half the flight time from Toronto to Istanbul and we couldn't sleep. After arriving at Istanbul airport, we had about 6 hours layover time. We decided to spent this time in the town. On our way back to airport due to getting caught in traffic jam, we reached the boarding gate after closing the gate while the airplane still was stopped at the gate. The staff didn't let us to get onboard and we missed our flight from Istanbul. After missing our flight we were told to go to the Care Point counter. This was the first office which we were referred to. They didn't provide us with any help and told us to go to the ticket sale office. Finding the right ticket sale office was like a marathon for us. There were several counters for ticket sale with Turkish Airline logo. After talking to two ticket sale office, we finally were directed to the main Turkish Airlines ticket sale office where we were told that they are not able to help us and we have to pay the full price for the business class for the flights in the next day. After that, they asked us to talk to the supervisor where we observed the worst treatment that a customer may experience. He even didn't let us to explain our story and didn't listen to us. He just asked us to contact customer care centre by phone. After about 15 minutes talk with customer care centre over the phone, they also told us that they are not able to help us. Finally after being passed to several offices and people by Turkish Airlines staff without getting any help, we decided to buy new tickets to Isfahan, Iran instead of Tehran for the next day from an agency at the airport. The new tickets were sold to us at full price without any discount for the missed flight. I showed the new tickets to the same supervisor to transfer our luggage to the new destination and also complained about his behavior with us. After all of these unpleasant stories, we went to the Turkish Airlines Hotel Desk, where they told us that because our tickets are new and not transit tickets, they cannot help us with accommodations in Istanbul, and we were forced to book a hotel from an agency at the airport.",Detractor

"  Istanbul to Washington. Turkish Airlines is still good. The catering on board is suffering from bean counter recommendations. Gone are the days when Business Class food on board Turkish Airlines was exceptional. Now it is ordinary. It is sad to see such short sighted measures being implemented which may have a long lasting impact on the airline's reputation. The flight was on time but the airplane was old. It was clean but the age showed. The most outstanding aspect of the flight was the crew. They were helpful, pleasant, attentive, and friendly. One crew member kept bringing me tea (without my asking) while I worked for about six hours. She always had a pleasant smile throughout the trip. I wrote this review to ensure that the crew's effort did not go unnoticed.",Promoter
"  London to Manila return via Istanbul. Check in was very quick we checked in 3 large suitcases with our 80kgs combined allowance we also had two carry on trolley cases a rucksack and suit holder asked if we could check in the rucksack to save dragging it around with us even though we were on the check in limit, yes sir no problem. Spent time in the business class lounge to wait for boarding. Arrived at the boarding gate checked through boarded the plane first. Flight London to Istanbul was 4 hours approx, seat was very comfortable flight attendants very good and spoke perfect English. There was a chef who came round and took our order for our meal. The food was excellent. IFE was good but not great could do with upgrading but acceptable. We arrived in Istanbul on time and were bussed to the terminal business class passengers were off the plane first and had there own bus. we had about two hours. so spent time in the Turkish Airlines Lounge then headed to our gate to board our plane for Manila. this is the only fault I found with this trip. There was no business class priority boarding just everybody trying to to get through the check in and only one member of staff checking tickets and passports absolutely ridiculous it was mayhem finally got through the check in and were last to board a waiting bus (I would not have liked to be first on the bus) to take us to the aircraft. We were welcomed on board by the flight attendants and given a pre flight drink and our suit holder was hung up for us. The seats were comfortable and spacious and turned into a flatbed with the ottoman at the foot and for once I actually slept during the flight which is a rarity for me. The IFE was the same as mentioned before Our section of the business cabin had 28 seats which less than half were occupied. Flight attendants were very attentive spoke perfect English. The chef came round asked to fill out a menu card for our breakfast at the end of our flight and also took our order for our meal again it was a fantastic meal the best we have had in the air. We were a little late taking off from Istanbul for our 12 hour flight but still arrived at Manila 1 hour early. We were first off the plane through immigration got to the carousel to pick our luggage our 4 bags because of the priority tags were in the first 10 bags we were out of Manila airport 25 minutes after getting off the plane.

"  Houston to Odessa via Istanbul. October 25th 2017 my mother supposed to fly Houston to Istanbul. It was cancelled for some technical reason. She was already in the airport, when the flight got delayed and cancelled later on. She spent 8 hours in the airport, from 7pm till 3am, was inside the plane for 1,5 hour and then got kicked out with everyone else. No one offered any complementary food, water wasn't given. Somehow at 3:30 am they provided the hotel, but she had to share it with the other 2 passengers not related to each other. The transport wasn't provided, so she had to pay for taxi from her own. By 11 am the hotel told them to check out. She left hotel and took taxi back to the airport. Only business class was take care of. We spent another 5 hours in the airport waiting for some news. At 5 pm they opened check in for another flight. After all this long upsetting time the new flight got delayed again! For another 1,5 hours.

  Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Quick check-in and boarding. The hard product is comfortable but lacks privacy due to 2x2x2 configuration of the business class cabin which means no direct aisle access for all seats. The FA's were pleasant and professional although their English was not very good. Food quality was average and below their historical standards. Toilets were kept reasonably clean and tidy throughout the journey. IFE had many choices but list of films needed an update with very few recent releases. Flight left on time and arrived a full hour ahead of schedule. The disembarkation via buses remains a total nuisance and mystery as there were plenty of vacant air bridges.

Overseas seats are not private and small. The land facilities were crowded, disorganized, and fairly dirty. A very low-end business class with fairly poor treatment.",Detractor
"  This is the first time I have flown Turkish Airlines and I had high expectations after seeing their commercials on TV and reading about them on various internet sites. I was flying business class from New York JFK to Bangkok via Istanbul (3 hour lay-over). My first leg was on a B777-300ER. The flight was 1 hour late departing JFK due to late arrival of the aircraft. The business class, flat bed configuration was 2x3x2, so even if you were seated in an aisle, you got disturbed by the other person wanting aisle access. I see this as a major draw-back on long flights (9 hours) when you are trying to sleep and someone is crawling over you multiple times to use the bathrooms. My second leg from Istanbul to Bangkok (also 9 hours) was on a A330 with a 2x2x2 business class configuration. On this plane you definitely want the middle seats as each person has direct aisle access. With that being said, the flat beds on both flights were spacious, comfortable and functional with lots of storage. The in-flight entertainment system was very good with an extensive and up-to-date selection of movies, TV shows, live sports etc. The food service was very good with the onboard chefs serving you. I did not use the WiFi, but it seemed it was difficult to connect to as many of the passengers in business class both flights were asking the flight attendants for assistance. The cabin staff were well trained, professional and attentive. Overall I would give them 4 stars, mostly due to the dual business class seat configuration when most of the Asian and Middle East carriers have individual pods and the one hour late departure from JFK.",Promoter

On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route.

"  Amsterdam to Mauritius, with a stopover in Istanbul. That part of the journey went well, without any problems, good service. The return trip was badly organized. On September 30th, flight TK161 (Mauritius-Istanbul) was scheduled for 20.05. First we received the announcement that the flight was delayed until 21:30. At 20:30 we had to go to another gate and then we heard that the flight was canceled. We had to go to another gate, were listed, had to pick up the luggage, went thru the passport check and after 1 hour we were transported by bus to hotels. Our hotel: Palms Hotel, Quatre Bornes, Mauritius, a 45-minute drive. Room was reasonable but did not seemed to be used recently, because all the lamps were still disconnected and we had no hot water. Dinner consisted of rice, red pepper potatoes, lettuce and a meat sauce. We have been able to rest for 3 hours because sleep was not possible due to the noise of a disco / nightclub. We were told that breakfast was served at 4pm at night, at the reception. But there was nobody, we had to switch on the lights ourselves. At 04:50 a few crackers, butter, slices of sausage, pineapple and yogurt were placed on a table. No coffee, tea, water, etc. Another group was lucky because they were transferred to a luxury hotel, where they could sleep and have a real breakfast. At 5:00pm the buses went to the airport. At 6:00 pm check-in, including luggage, but the staff was very chaotic, there was no supervision. We were promised that they were already arranging the transition stopover in Istanbul. At 8:30 the plane left for Istanbul where we arrived more than 9 hours later. Some people who also had a transfer flight, received a boarding pass at the exit of the gate, but most had to go to the Transfer Desk very quickly. There we were totally hopeless when we saw a queue of 80, perhaps 100 people. A hard-working employee selected 20 persons. Fortunately, we belonged to that group (entirely random) that was brought to a Business Transfer Desk after a 2nd quick 10 minute walk. At first, they wanted or could not handle anything for us. Eventually they gave the Amsterdam people of that group, new boarding passes, TK1955 Istanbul-Amsterdam from 19:30. We were lucky because we arrived at 22:05 in Amsterdam. When we got there, we missed 1 of our 2 suitcases. And we were not the only victims, because the entire handling and registration cost us 2 hours extra time. Sunday night at 2:00 we were at home, at last. Monday afternoon we were told that the suitcase was found and was kept behind in Istanbul. End well, all right, we would like to say, but not in this case, definitely not. We still do not know what the reason for the flight cancellation was. We wondered ourselves, again and again why everything went so extremely wrong. A technical defect can happen and that they do not want to take any risks, we all understand that. However, during our hotel stay and flight to Istanbul, Turkish Airlines had 22 hours to arrange a connecting flight + boarding passes for all, but nothing seemed to be arranged. Why were we dragged from one place to another, had to watch desperate and exhausted how their employees had heated discussions and everything was so organized badly?",Detractor
"  Cluj-Napoca to Singapore via Istanbul and it was one of the best flight experiences so far. You can freely book your seat in advance (unlike on some airlines where you have to pay for your seat if reserving in advance or they'll seat you miles apart). We flew on an A320 for the short 1 hour flight to IST. The service was great, and my choice on their website for a lactose free meal was met, which was a nice surprise, taking into account the length of the flight. If you have more than a 6 hour layover in Istanbul (which we did), free tours of Istanbul are offered at various times. We took the 6 hour tour, and the tour itself, although a little rushed, was way better than sitting around in the airport. A free meal and entry tickets to attractions are included in the tour. The Boeing 777 to Singapore was impeccable. In flight entertainment is offered in each headrest with various movies, TV shows, live TV and selections of music. The food is very good and the staff is very kind and helpful. Seats are comfortable and although the pitch could be better, most people around me, including myself could find a position to sleep through most of the 10 hour flight.

I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class. The reason this is so impressive is that he had to go against the inbuilt systems to delight a customer.

"  London to Mombasa via Istanbul, after being told and having my ticket verified by a lady agent at the international transit desk just before passport control that i qualify for a free transit hotel for a layover as my transit time was 18hours. I also met the other requirements such as being in transit from a Turkish Airlines flight to another Turkish Airline flight that was international as well as the connection flight being the only option hence being forced by the Turkish Airlines schedule structure thus requiring a layover as there was no shorter connection from Istanbul with Turkish Airlines on the same day. After having arrived at the hotel desk with people who just got of the flight I was told that the hotels were full and there was nothing he could do about it apart from offering me a voucher to compensate for the hotel for a bus trip around Istanbul at 7am - bearing in mind that its was 2am and I had no sleep. Long story short he claimed to be the supervisor and a colleague beside him the manager, he gave me a counter number for the Turkish Airlines customer service number to which I called and was told I met the requirements but they wouldn't provide, forcing me to give up. I not only wasted $30 for the visa required to get through passport control but my time. They also use a trick to bypass the free transit hotel: If they are aware of long delays (more than 10 hours) they just break down 1 big delay into multiple short delays. If they adds flights to their schedule between the time of booking and date of travel they will not offer the hotel.",Detractor

I believe I had to get upset like other passengers to receive better dinner and service. I have been flying with Turkish Airlines for 15 years and have lost confidence for the quality service and competency of keeping passengers satisfaction.,Detractor
"  Toronto to Istanbul. Check in and boarding were smooth. Onboard, the aircraft interior looked worn, the air was stale and sticky. The socks and bottles of salad dressing from the previous flight were left on the seat indicating a poor clean-up and prep effort. The seat was comfortable in both the upright and lie flat position allowing me to get a decent night's sleep. The catering was a let-down and a significant deterioration from what I have experienced on previous TK flights. There were no pre meal canapÃ©s, appetizers were limited and main course was bone dry. The wine list featured the same labels as they had 12 months ago. The IFE was OK but could have used more recent releases. The FA's were slow in their service and tended to mill around the galley. Toilets were kept in reasonably good state throughout the flight. The wifi was good and operated without interruption. The flight left late but landed on schedule. Overall it was a decent experience but the decline in catering quality was very obvious.",Passive
"  Bad experience I was flying from Istanbul to Prague by TK1769 on Aug 28. The plane has been A321 and I have never seen such a worn out plane. Personal entertainment system was not functioning. The biggest problem was that my seat did not fix in upright position, which was making both me and the passenger behind very uncomfortable. I felt like plane must be 20 years+ old just to find out it is ex Jet Airways (India) plane, only 8.5 years old. The plane was really poor and crew visibly uninterested to try resetting entertainment system or finding a suitable seat for me. They did not care. Very disappointing.",Detractor
"  Cologne to Shiraz via Istanbul. My first plane was delayed in Cologne so I couldn't catch my next flight so Turkish Airlines offered a ticket for my final destination which was due in 18 hours. In such situations you can either go to a hotel and rest or take a city tour. The hotel was supposedly 5 star, I would not say that my residence was bad, but I prefer to be home on time.",Passive
"  London to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. Really impressed with the hard products and 9 abreast seats in B777 economy. Even more impressed with the live television services, though limited channels. I would not have imagined watching a UEFA Champions League / World Cup qualifier game whilst travelling intercontinental. Food is good relative to other airlines. Was relieved that my check-in luggage made it through to Kuala Lumpur, after there was a 50 minutes delay from my departure at Heathrow. At Istanbul, I was off the plane and straightaway dashed to my connection gate. Made it into the connection to Kuala Lumpur, but was resigned that my luggage wouldn't make it and may come in on the following flight. Thankfully, it reached KUL together with me. One reservation about the hardproduct is seat pitch, especially on the A330. I'm 6 foot 1, and really feel the tightness. Not much improvement on the B777, but perhaps bearable for a 9 hours flight.",Passive
"  London to Riyadh via Istanbul. I booked a seat by the window on the right-hand side. The flight left at 01:20 so I expected to be able to sleep. On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row (31, I believe, the second to last row) but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat - 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's. One good point was she had a huge, blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future, with a different airline of course.",Detractor
"  Hong Kong - Istanbul - Copenhagen on B777-300 and A321, respectively. Flew 5+6 September 2017. Both flights on time. I arrived very early due to few connections to HKG from my departure town Danang by Vietnam with a LCC carrier, Jetstar. Thus I had to leave transit and pick luggage after immigration. However, I could not check in early in HKG so I had to take the Airport Express train and backtrack myself some 40 km downtown for city check in which is possible 8 hours prior to departure while in Airport only 4 hours are granted. The city check-in took 2 minutes when finally there, but to access the Kowloon station in question (for city check-in) took me >1 hour. By checking in there I got rid of my luggage and the BP issued granted me lounge access upon returning to HKG airport. I tried all three Star-alliance lounges and found Silverkris having the best food, drinks, and staff, while the Thai and United lounges had stunning panorama view towards the tarmac making up for modest food and drink supplies (and no champagne) and very few staff. Onboard the FAs are friendly and caring. However, all appear to be of only one (Turkish?) nationality. This is a pity as they obvious have received limited, internal training - which results in a less perfect flight experience as the FA's, in general, have lower skills and possess limited, modest exposure. The wandering cook onboard is superfluous in my view and makes a clown out of himself. IFE good. Headphones were of superb quality (â€œDevonâ€). Chairs turned into spacious flat beds. Full set of bedsheets provided. Toilets clean throughout. Food was very good with options. Two full meal rounds served on this 12 hour flight - plus dine on demand was apparently possible (hot snacks). Drinks fine with G.H. Mumms champagne. Transit in Istanbul is normally a hassle but this time it went smooth and no queues. CIP lounge is a breeze â€“ I had nice shower and a delicious breakfast. The last sector IST-CPH was on an A321-200 with true business class seats (2 x 2 configuration) and good service including offering champagne in mini-bottles. Only 6 seats were occupied (out of 20) on this morning flight. IFE also good.",Promoter

We were informed by the employee there, to get to another gate which was wrong walking again for a long distance and then finally got at the transfer desk, where after a long waiting que we were informed for our overnight stay in a hotel in Istanbul so as to get the flight of 7.00 am to Budapest.

"  Brussels to Istanbul. Business class has the typical recliners that are better than most airlines in narrow body aircraft. My check in experience in Brussels was horrible. The business class check in agent was unexperienced and arrogant.

I went to see the station manager, had to repack stuff whereafter she once sgain said it was too much. Another trip to station manager and with some dont do it again words he let me go. I had to run to get on my plane. One thing is for sure I wont do it again and will choose another airline. I recommend the airline not to use such personalities for customer service.",Passive
"  Buenos Aires to Barcelona via Istanbul. Seats are ok, but not the best. The good thing is that they are fully flat, the bad thing is that they do not all offer direct aisle access (and that there are 3 seats together in the middle row in business class). That said, I also have to say that the Buenos Aires - Istanbul flight is very long because of the stop in Sao Paulo, but flying business class in TK makes it seem shorter, the IFE is quite good and the food is great. I take this flight twice a year and even though the food service deteriorated a bit lately, it is still very good compared to other airlines (unfortunately on my last flights there was no more amuse bouche, no more many options of starters to pick from the trolley and no more final trolley with coffee and petit fours-the latter was now consolidated with the dessert trolley, also the champagne on board was downgraded from Taittinger to Mumm). As I said the meals service is still good but it could be a lot better if flight attendants would be more proactive at offering drinks and refills. They just do not do it, you need to call them every time you need a refill (it does not happen in many other airlines) and when you do they take forever and it is obvious are not willing to do it. Overall, I would recommend TK business class because the food is very good and the seats are confortable, but they need to improve the service on board. If they did, they would be quite perfect.",Passive
  Dammam to London via Istanbul. Paid for seat reservations on both flights and they were not honoured. When I asked the flight team I was told there was nothing that could be done. When I then complained to the airline I was basically told that changes to aircrafts are made and they don't feel the need to inform you of those changes or refund the price that you have paid for the seat reservations. Deeply unhappy. I will not be using them again.,Detractor

"  For my vacation to Turkey I decided to fly with Turkish Airlines instead of a charter airline like SmartWings. We boarded an A321-200 in Prague, seats were really nice with really good pitch and each seat has personal IFE which is geat for a 2 hours flight. The headphones were not very good, but thats ok. Problem was that for half of the flight the IFE wasn't working, but when it did it had plenty of movies, games, music etc. We received a warm sandwich and dessert on this flight which were tasty along with a good seletion of drinks, only problem was that only 1 drinks round was made. Second flight was on a Boeing 737-800 which was a bit older and only had screens above our heads, but it was a 55 minute flight (on the way back this flight was operated by A321-200 with IFE) and even on this short flight we received drinks and food (same sandwich just no dessert). Overall these were really nice flights and I would fly with Turkish again. The A321 was really nice and IFE for 2 hours flight is great, it is just the crew that could be little bit better.",Promoter
"  Johannesburg to Brussels via Istanbul. Our first holiday that we flew with Turkish Airlines and probably our last. However we are satisfied about the staff on board, it's the lack of customer care that makes the final result of this review. As we arrived home we found out that one of the locks of our suitcases was damaged in a way that this lock could not be used any more. No message of Customs was left. An inquiry at Samsonite showed that this part can not be repaired. So we are forced to buy a new suitcase because of this damage. Turkish Airlines is responsible to take care of our bagage and if some problem occurs, they should offer a solution. Challenge 1 is to find out how to claim damaged baggage. Found on the internet and made a claim the next day. Challenge 2 is to convince Turkish Airlines (Customer Care) about the real cause of the damage, since they decline a claim immediately. Challenge 3 is to convince them about the fact that the suitcase is not repairable. If it would be, we should send it to a national Samsonite repair center (costs!). But they confirmed that the lock is no longer available (only during the warranty time of 5 years). A copy of these emails were sent to TA, but the refuse to accept it and think about another solution. Challenge 4 is to convince TA that for me the only solution is that I have to buy a new suitcase, which I did, and to get a refund as compensation. I bought a new Samsonite, sent my invoice to them and asked them to solve this matter, but again they answered that only repairs will be paid. When you pay over 2500 Euros for your tickets, you have the right to expect customer service as it should be. Let's end positive about the airplane and staff. The airplane is new well cleaned and you there is a lot of entertainment to choose on your personal screen. Staf is really friendly and drinks and meals are alright. We just did not understand why on a night flight it took so long to get your meal after the take off. It would be nice to get it earlier and then get some more time to sleep.",Detractor

"  Jakarta to Sao Paulo return via Istanbul with Boeing 777-300ER in Business Class. I felt that the entertainment screen is quite small, it is adequate but would be great if we could enjoy larger screen size. Food options were satisfying and presentation was nice thanks to Do&Co catering. It would be great if they offer flexibility to their pax to be able to opt to dine whenever they wish (not only in a designated meal service time). This is particularly for the red-eye flight like Sao Paulo-Istanbul which depart at 3am and a meal was served just after take off. Cabin crew polite and courteous especially Indonesian-bound flight. Lounge at Istanbul was great with many food selections but much fewer when you departing late at night. One most point that need to be improved is the boarding arrangement at the Departure Gate especially for Business Class Passengers ! There was indeed a special Line for business class pax but mostly were blocked by the long economy pax queue that we had to struggle to find the dedicated line for business class pax.",Promoter

"  Flying Turkish Airlines is always a good if not great experience regardless of what class you are flying. But I have to say that what distinguishes TK from any other airline I have travelled with, and I do travel a lot for both work and leisure, is the customer service. It is absolutely exceptional. I have missed my flight with a different airline twice, because of the airport I flew out of and both times Turkish airlines saved my trip! Even though they were not responsible for the problems I had in the airports or with the airlines, because my connecting flights were through Turkish Airlines they were the people that got me on the next flight in a most convenient timeframe and manner. The first time I travelled with Turkish Airlines, the representative even booked a hotel for me, because I was a college student traveling to the US for the first time and I missed my flight with a different airline because of a long customs line in the airport. Not only that but they also rebooked my three connecting flights for the next day and provided all the information I would need to have a safe comfortable stay in a strange city.

"  Istanbul to Bangkok. After several positive flight experiences with Turkish Airlines, my last flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was very disappointing. The flight boarded, albeit somewhat chaotically, on time. Once all passengers were on board, we waited for about 1 hour before an announcement was made that the aircraft needed to be changed due to technical problems. That in itself was not a major problem, though somewhat of an inconvenience, however attention to safety was appreciated. Once we were back in the gate boarding area, there was only one ground agent who seemed to have no idea how to cope with the situation. No announcements were made. Once a new departure time was set for 2 hours later, we boarded a new aircraft. The cabin staff seem to have been affected by all of this, as our flight was now almost 3 hours delayed. After serving the meal they were nowhere to be seen for a long time, some left with empty meal trays for 1 hour before passengers had had enough and started clearing their own trays by bringing them to the galley. I made a comment about this inconvenience to the flight purser, who told me that he would have to ""write me up"" for making a complaint about the long wait time for clearing up after the meal service. I was disappointed by this attitude and treatment.",Passive
"  Flew Dalaman to Istanbul Ataturk. Found the Business Class check-in tucked away in the corner of a seething departure hall. Showing my Gold card, I was politely and promptly checked in. I was told where to find the CIP lounge. In there it felt more like a school playground with children running noisily around in circles. Obviously not the fault of Turkish Airlines. Slight delay in boarding as the aircraft came in late. No boarding announcements made (until I boarded at least) but people just moved forward. One lady called out something in barely audible Turkish language, but nothing in English. Before take-off they showed the safety briefing on drop-down screens. Those screens then remained down, just showing the Turkish Airlines logo, throughout the flight. In fact they were still down as we got off the plane in Istanbul. After take-off the Captain explained and apologised for the delay. We were served a warm cheese and tomato roll with soft and hot drinks. In fact identical to the snack when I flew from Istanbul a few days earlier. But it was welcome and tasty and perfectly adequate for 11.30 pm. Two very smiling and friendly flight attendants served us. As we flew in circles the Captain announced a change in runway meant a further 15 minutes delay. We finally landed - with the only occupant in the row in front of me in his seat fully reclined. After landing we were told we could use our electronic devices so I looked at the flight path we had flown. It was certainly convoluted!

Biggest negative was the very tight leg-room on the long-legs of this trip, especially since the person in front of me put their seat back as soon as we took off for the entire 10 hour trip. Big suggestion - get on the plane as soon as you can so you can store your carry-on in the overhead compartment, otherwise you are in big trouble for leg room. I felt claustrophobic on the Boston to Istanbul leg because of this issue.

"  Bangkok to London via Istanbul. First leg from Bangkok was an A330. Flight was delayed due to weather in BKK, unfortunately they only announced the delay after everyone had gone to the gate. Flight boarded about 45 min late and the crew were not quite ready when passengers boarded as they had arrived late and seemed a bit stressed about the delay which stuck with them for most of the flight. Despite the stress they were friendly and provided a good service. Welcome drinks were served but they ran out of TK's signature lemonade, which is a bit poor. That said the flight was otherwise great, dinner was served swiftly after take off and the food was a huge improvement on the outbound flight. The steak was one of the best I have had on a flight for years. After dinner beds were made and the lights were turned off. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing and this time the crew did remember to collect the breakfast orders so everything was served correctly. Despite the delay in take off we landed on time in IST. Transfer security were not quite awake when we showed up at 4 am in IST but we got through quickly and on to the excellent lounge at IST. While the lounge is excellent, by 6am is was extremely busy and seat were hard to come by. As personal electronic devices has to be gate checked for travel to the UK the gate process took about 15 minutes to get through but TK has done a fairly good job of streamlining the process, especially for business class passengers. Boarding was reasonably organised and boarding for the LHR flight was quickly completed. Flight this time was a Boeing 777 which left on time from IST. Again breakfast was quickly served. While the hot choice was limited is was tasty none the less. The cabin crew was far more relaxed on this flight and an absolute pleasure. Flight landed on time at LHR.

"  Beijing to Atlanta via Istanbul. The flight itself was very good. My issue is with the mediocre to bad service outside of the flight.

I made sure that I purchased the ticket with the correct code (B) since you can only upgrade on Y and B codes. Then I upgraded the ticket using my miles, but was then told that the upgrade would change the code to an I. Code I does means that I get no miles for the flight even though I paid full price for the ticket. I tried to contact Turkish Airlines through their website and received no reply. I tried to contact them through their social media sites and was told to be patient and I would receive a reply. Two weeks later I checked the status and found out that Turkish Airlines had canceled my ticket. I contacted my travel agent who found out that my upgrade had created a duplicate ticket in their system so they had just canceled everything, all without informing me.

"  Cape Town to Athens via Istanbul. They charge for sporting equipment stating it's a 'handling fee'. They are happy to take golf bags and skis free of charge, and diving equipment to three destinations free of charge, but the rest of the world they charge for. It really can't be that hard to handle some fins, a mask and a very small speargun for no charge can it, especially when these make up the only form of checked in baggage? And they do not weigh more than golf equipment or don't take up more space than a golf bag. I've never dealt with an airline that has such inconsistent rules regarding baggage, and made taking other goods overseas so difficult. Speaking to customer service they can't do anything either. Oh and they don't charge sports baggage fees as a single trip return, they charge for each destination where you stop / layover, both there and back, so you could pay up to 90 euros one way,and the same return.",Detractor
"  Delayed take off from Seoul to Athens via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines . Longer trip time (10.5 hours) from the reverse trip (Istanbul to Seoul) though the present voyage is anti-clock wise i.e. you earn some distance from earth's clockwise rotation. Same flight from Istanbul to Seoul was 9.5 hrs. Insufficient cleanliness of the cabin. Normal service. Food variety short. Seats on both flights had small space with front seat, knees were stuck on front seat for a medium size man (1.75 height).",Passive
"  London to Guangzhou via Istanbul. I chose Turkish Airline on this occasion instead of my regular Qatar Airways. Was a bit apprehensive choosing this airline but what a fantastic airline it turn out to be, flights were punctual, priority boarding at all sectors, attentive and smiling FAs plus a chef on board preparing food which was very tasty and flatbed seats on both aircraft. The only issue, nothing to do with the airline, is the last leg, Istanbul to London and it can be daunting especially after a 10 hour flight where you go through security checks twice and no laptops on hand baggage. Although flying Business Class, the queues is very much the same as travelling economy and it took forever. Apart from the security checks at IST, everything else was as good if not better than some other 5* airlines I have flown. Give this airline a try and you will be pleasantly surprised.",Promoter
"  Gatwick to Bangkok via Istanbul. The arrival experience could be stepped up slightly. There really isn't much of a welcome when you first arrive on board. It takes a while for you to be offered a drink and for a business class traveller, I didn't get any service really throughout the whole flight. There was on both legs of the flight a few moody staff members. The seat itself is really good. Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board. Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price. I can let the attention they don't provide to the customers go, but it does need to be addressed. There also doesn't seem to be anything available to snack on in-between meals. I have flown with them a few times and nothing has been on show or shown in the menu.",Promoter
"  Flew London Heathrow to Bangkok via Istanbul. TK1980/TK0064. Decided to go with Turkish Airlines as they had a compelling offer for the holidays. Check-in at LHR was quick and efficient, priority security check provided and access to any of the Star Alliance lounges in Terminal 2 (LH, United, Singapore or Canadian or the Premium Plaza lounge which TK contracts). Boarding began a little late and started somewhat disorganised with conflicting announcements but once the gate agents got them selves sorted boarding was quick and efficient. Lunch was served on the short flight to IST, single tray with 3 options for main course. Not great but beats most airlines. Seat was fully flat and IFE was excellent although no WiFI on this flight. The cabin attendants were a bit robotic but very nice. Flight was on time in to IST and when straight to a gate. On disembarkation there was a choice for connecting flights or arrivals but it looked like they had cordoned off the connecting flight route. Turned out they wanted to see boarding passes to let you through, slightly confusing and not very intuitive. Next flight was also on time, this time there was WiFi on top of the excellent IFE and although the WiFi was slow it worked well through the flight. The cabin crew were fantastic with the attendants looking after our section coming around at the beginning of the flight to introduce herself and point out the cabin service director as well. Seats were comfortable and everything worked with the cabin clean and tidy upon boarding. Amenity kits were handed out shortly after boarding. The evening meal was served about 45 minutes after take off. The starter and desert were great but the mains were pathetic, labelled as â€œsalad and steakâ€ it took some searching of the salad to find the miniature piece of beef. Meals have clearly declined with TK. We were given cards to order breakfast but they were never collected and the breakfast handout was a bit random and the hot options were a bit strange but tasted ok none the less. Overall a good flight, worth recommending if the price point is right.",Promoter

"  Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Check-in slower than normal for priority lane on account of extra layer of checks for flights bound for North America. Boarding by zone numbers and quite orderly. On board, the hard product was a little weathered with scuff marks and torn trim. The flight left the gate 35 minutes late and there was no reason provided other than ""operational issues"". Once airborne, a 5-course lunch was served along with a wide range of drink choices. The food was quite tasty and well presented. The FA's were warm, friendly and very attentive. A special mention goes out to the staff who looked after my side of the aisle with a permanent smile and cheery demeanour throughout the entire flight. The IFE had a good selection but was awkward to navigate at times. Tolilets needed attention and were not always clean / tidy. Flight landed 30 minutes late and for an unknown reason we disembarked via airside buses which is extremely rare for Montreal.

"  I was particularly looking forward to TK 1, my first trans-Atlantic business class experience. In most aspects, the flight was outstanding. Lamentably, the only negative occurred right at the start. Check-in went quickly, and the Gold Track security line was instantaneous. I did not have much time to experience the TK lounge because the TV monitors called passengers to the gate and hour and a half before departure. Gate 208 at IST was an absolute caldron. Of course, the security checks for USA departures are extensive, and as I had been informed, my ipad needed to be gate-checked. The problem was waiting and waiting in a huge crowd in a painfully hot gate area. By the time we boarded, I was drenched in perspiration. This is a problem that must be addressed, because a flight that begins uncomfortably in the extreme has to struggle to get back into pleasant territory. Nevertheless, once we boarded, the experience was exceptional. Seating on the 777-300 is 2x3x2. Every seat was occupied, but the seats themselves were full recline and provided adequate room. It almost goes without saying that the DO & CO food onboard was plentiful and delicious. TK provides a dining experience comparable to that of a fine restaurant. Cabin service was outstanding, and passengers who wanted to work or surf were provided with a laptop. The various quirks of the laptop took some time to decipher, but in the end, this provided several hours of amusement. There was a huge selection of movies, music, games, and TV shows. If Turkish Airlines can get control of the boarding experience, their business class service would be easily a 10.",Promoter

"  Toronto to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Having had my original flight out of Montreal cancelled and rerouted through Toronto with a 24-hour delay, I was bracing for the worst. Contrary to my expectations, everything from check-in through to landing was in perfect order. Flight pulled from the gate slightly behind schedule but landed early. On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep. Toilets were kept clean throughout the journey. It was a pleasant experience on the balance and the cabin chief deserved special mention given how he handled my request to be moved to another seat.",Passive
"  Montreal to Istanbul on TK36. Arrived at the airport 2 hours prior to departure only to find out check-in had been suspended. Passengers were left waiting in the queues for quite sometime before the TK station manger popped up and told everyone the flight had been cancelled. What ensued can only be described as chaos with agents running around collecting contact information from passengers so that they could be notified of their rerouted itinerary. TK operates three flights per week on this route with the next flight scheduled to leave only on Friday. This resulted in a long and extremely slow moving queue in front of the ticketing counter as two agents tried to reprocess a plane load of people. The rest of the ground staff ran around looking like they knew what they were doing but accomplishing next to nothing. The station manager was nowhere to be found with many passengers demanding answers. As the flight is often the very last one of the day, there were no other options left to get the passengers out on the same day with many having to contend with at least a one-day delay. Flight disruptions are an unavoidable part of air travel but TK is not equipped to deal with them as evidenced by the lack of coordination and inefficiency. Their call centre was equally ineffective as they kept saying there was nothing they could do. If TK is well and truly aspiring to become one of the leading carriers, they need to significantly pick up their game in customer relations and response to unforeseen events.",Detractor

"  Turkish Airlines makes a real effort to give even their economy passengers a positive experience. Their meals are tasty and generous. They distribute printed menus and amenity kits. Their check in staff are friendly and efficient. My originating United Airlines flight from Tampa was cancelled at the last minute, and after much scrambling, I arrived at the Turkish counter at JFK only 50 minutes before scheduled departure to IST. The flight had just closed, but the Turkish staff took pity on me and checked me in anyway. Both flights (New York JFK to Istanbul and Istanbul to Madrid) departed and arrived punctually. Despite the fact that the on-line seat map showed that the Kennedy - Ataturk flight was essentially empty up until the day before, when we boarded there were only a handful of empty seats. Where did those 150 mystery passengers come from? The economy class seat pitch is quite tight, I would have paid extra for an exit row seat, but it had appeared that I was going to have the whole back of the plane to myself. On the IST-MAD flight, we had an empty middle seat, and this contributed to a much more comfortable experience. My flight back to Turkey and the USA next week will be in business class, so I am looking forward to the award-winning premium service.",Passive

Airline announced that the flight is cancelled due to aircraft technical issues. Next 6 hours were spent in a queue waiting for the decision on how we will reach our destination. When we reached an airline representative all she could offer us was either to return a money for the trip or to take a next possible flight, which was in 1 week. Airline representative also didn`t offer any other option like booking another airline via another airport. Moreover, they didn`t offer any compensation.",Detractor

Most cabin crews on Kuala Lumpur - Istanbul sector were nice and polite except one male crew looked grumpy but he still did the job well. Nothing to complain from Istanbul to Venice. Toilet was clean and with proper amenities. We got nice blanket, pillow and nice pouch (Kuala Lumpur - Istanbul sector) full of flying amenities such as lip balm, socks, eye shade, toothbrush and ear plug which are nice. AVOD needs improvement on film and song selection. Need to provide some asian movies and songs including in Chinese/Mandarin.

"  London Heathrow to Sharm el Sheik via Istanbul. The flight itself was fine - not notably good or bad compared to many other airlines I have been on. My bag was delayed on the connection which was annoying but acceptable for a day, but less ideal when it became a second day with no explanation or contact from Turkish Airlines. But, their response to the issue was the worst and most customer unfriendly service I have ever had from any provider or any service, and has remained so for weeks. No ability to raise the issue by email, and online service down. No-one seeming to read anything submitted, in favour of moving it to another department as fast as possible and not just once, but time and time again. Asking for image of my passport (that they didn't need), over an online submission form that is insecure, in breach of their own privacy policy and all passably acceptable practice",Detractor
"  Amsterdam to Amman via Istanbul. This trip was a 4 day trip with checked-in luggage. In both Amsterdam and Amman as well in transit in Istanbul we could use priority facilities allowing us to skip the lines for security. Turkish Airlines uses the Aspire Lounge in the Non-Schengen area of Schiphol Airport which was crowded and poorly stocked with food and drink options. In Amman they use the Royal Jordanian lounge which is spacious and well stocked with food and drink. During the 2 layover in Istanbul we used the Turkish Airline lounge which is huge with a lot of amenities and food options and again a good WIFI network. We even found some time to toy around with the Golf simulator on the lower floor of the lounge. The flights were the typical medium haul service, all 4 flights left reasonably in time and arrived spot on time at destination. On the day flights between Amsterdam and Istanbul a lunch respectively breakfast were offered. All the food was tasty and nicely presented. During the night flights between Istanbul and Amman, prior to take-off we were offered diner respectively breakfast but in both cases we opted to sleep which was perfectly possible in the sleeper seats in he A340 and A330.

"  Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. TK uses a dedicated business class check in with extra passport formalities for flights bound for Canada, USA, UK and Israel. This process was slow and added time to the check in process. Flight boarded slightly late but in an orderly fashion. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with ample storage space for small articles. The overhead bin space however was limited due to the bedding they keep on hand. Drinks and lunch were offered after take off and having traveled the same route 6 weeks prior I was surprised to see the same menu. Despite that the food and wines were tasty and the service was with a smile. IFE had a good selection but the navigation was awkward at times. The Denon noise cancelling headphones were great. For reasons I have yet to understand Turkish turns on the cabin lights 3 hours prior to landing to serve an afternoon snack. Many other airlines do the same but not that far in advance of touchdown. This limits the amount of sleep you can expect to get. The wifi worked only part of the flight. It was an all around good flight with a great cabin crew.

As we flew from Kuala Lumpur there were some specialities like the fact that you are not able to buy water or go to a restroom after passing the security check, but this has certainly nothing to do with the airline, just the preamble to explain my later impatience. After boarding, it took the crew about 3 hours to organize the supper, what might be on schedule but beverages came even later! Never saw a crew being so messy. Almost every member constantly dropped something: our food, their own food, once they managed to drop a pasta portion twice. I asked for two beverages but the lady forgot my second request instantly (never happened before). So the whole catering procedure was messy, slow and ineffective. For the second meal the crew forgot our veggie meals, forgot to mention that the meals they offered contained meat. They were not rude nor disagreeable, just made this hard day far harder than it should be. Would try to avoid Turkish Airline for long flights from now on. By the way, the short flight from Istanbul to Zurich (3 h) in an old aircraft was perfectly organized.",Passive

"  Sarajevo to Panama City via Istanbul. The first leg SJJ-IST was in a Boeing 737 in Row 1 with what must have been the worst leg-room I've witnessed in Business on a 737. The bulkhead is in front of your face and the only position to sit is upright. Fortunately the business class section was not full so I moved to a seat in Row 2, which had the seat in front of you to put your feet under. The service was good, and the meal was very good for so short a flight. The Istanbul to Panama City segment was on a semi-antiquated A330-200 which is 4 rows in a 2-2-2 configuration. The seat is comfortable for sitting upright and to a certain extent it is comfortable for relaxing. It is dreadful for sleeping, because the seat is so configured that in the ""angled flat"" position you slide down. I resolved this by putting my briefcase in the space under the seat in front of mine, and the briefcase then elevated my feet sufficiently to provide support to be able to lay comfortably without struggling to avoid sliding down the incline. The food on this carrier is much better than most European carriers, and light-years ahead of US carriers. The flight crew are sufficiently attentive to function without being over-the-top. When they finish serving, they disappear, and if you want something you'll need to call them and ask for it, or get up and get it yourself- they won't come by and volunteer. But the price is much cheaper than competitors on this route, and that forgives a lot. Overall, for the price, I'm more than satisfied. But if I had to pay full going price of European carriers, I'd fly Lufthansa or Air France, with flat bed seats and a more professional operation.

The connecting flight was also Turkish Airlines, but still there was no support at the airport even though their first flight was late. While coming back from Mumbai, at Istanbul, there was an additional security check and the queue was long and our flight was in 15 mins! Nobody gave us any support there either and by some luck, one of the fellow passengers in the same situation was told by people waiting with us that we can go to priority security check if the flight is leaving soon. There was no sign for this or any indication from either Turkish Airlines or airport staff. We barely made it to the next flight 2 mins before gate closed even though the aircraft didn't take off for next 30 mins or more.

"  Tel Aviv to Milan via Istanbul SAW return with Turkish Airlines. An early start Tel Aviv to Istanbul, 0620, Boeing 738, the usual service, nicely groomed flight attendants, polite, helpful. A cold snack and arrival in stormy Istanbul just to disembark the aircraft by uncovered stairs, nice wet welcome to Turkey. Transit area very crowded, mostly with Pegasus passengers. Istanbul to Milan, again by bus and this time covered stairs. A320, again, nice crew, hot lunch, full bar service. Arrival at MXP with a full security screening as if we were about to depart. Never been screened before anywhere entering a country. May have to do with our origin. Return, a quick friendly check in at Milan but terrible long lines at security and passport control. No gate posted for the departure until 55 min before, so uneasy walking around not knowing which wing to proceed to. Long tarmac delay with no explanation from TK. In general their English annoucements are difficult to understand. A320 with a friendly crew, nice hot lunch and a nice bar service. This time a jetway in Istanbul, good shopping, but staff does not speak English. Is this an International airport? Then get personnel who can assist in English. Istanbul to Tel Aviv on an A320, every seat taken, very bumpy, cabin too warm (seems to be the norm with TK) but crew managed to serve a nice cold snack and a full bar service.",Promoter

"  Istanbul to Washington. I am overall happy with Turkish Airlines seat comfort, food quality, cabin service, etc. The lounge at Washington Dulles Airport is excellent and probably the best at that airport. I want to address the way they handle the laptop ban imposed by USA and UK. The devices that are not checked in the luggage, are accepted by the airline representatives at the boarding gate, after all the passport and security checks. The devices are wrapped in bubble packs and a special receipt is given to the passenger. The wrapped devices are placed in sturdy containers before your very eyes. At the other end, Turkish Airlines have a stand right after you clear the passport control but before clearing the customs. They check your receipt and give you back your laptop. No muss no fuss. Under the circumstances the operation is pretty smooth. I thought travelers should know.",Promoter
"  Singapore-Istanbul-Lisbon (return) on TK in mid-March. Turkish Airlines pretty much exceeded my expectations on the outward leg of my journey, and the service was even better on the return. Check-in and boarding in Singapore went swiftly, on board the A333 to Istanbul the food, drinks service and entertainment was excellent (you'll receive a menu for the service). Also received the best amenities kit of any airline I've flown - not even Qatar gives out slippers and lip balm in theirs! No amenities kit on the Istanbul-Lisbon sector but it was more of the same: good entertainment, good food and drinks on board a clean B738. Cabin crew were very friendly on both sectors. Return sector was even better - the flight left the gate at Lisbon Airport on time. Good service once again with the regular drinks service, delicious meal of roasted meat and a very friendly bunch of flight attendants The entertainment system on board the A320 winglets was better than my outgoing flights, with a better touchscreen interface. Departure from Istanbul-Singapore also on-time, with a new A333 that had the newest entertainment system on board (it has live news from BBC and CNN). Good meal service once again with a relish pasta rigatoni, although I wish they didn't run out of meal choices on board. A slightly different brand of amenities kit was given out on this flight, but the contents were the same. On-time arrival in Singapore. The only thing that I didn't like was the seat and legroom on the Singapore-Istanbul sector, but overall Turkish Airlines put a smile on my face. I look forward to flying with them again.",Promoter
  Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Used the business class check in which was hassle free. The lounge in Istanbul offered a great array of drink and meal options but the shower facilities were falling apart and appeared in need of an upgrade. Boarding was on time and orderly and we left on time. On board the seating was comfortable and FA's were attentive. Turkish Airlines catering is on a serious decline with portions smaller and quality not what it used to be. My main course was two pieces of overcooked thin slices of beef. The meal before landing was also disappointing. The wine selection was OK and Tattinger was appreciated. Toilets were not kept clean and I had to point out to FA's on two occoasions the need for a touch up. The wifi was reliable. Thee IFE was decent but could have used more recent movie releases. Announcements from the cockpit were scarce with flight details provided only in the beginning. Flight arrived ahead of schedule.,Passive
"  Amsterdam to Manila, via Istanbul with about 1hr layover in Istanbul and 5hr on the return flight. The price was very good for this route. This was my first time flying with Turkish Airlines and it was just fairly good. IFE had a good selection of movies also to keep me entertained, and they give you amenity kit which is nice. The planes were fairly nice too, minus on the way back home, Istanbul to Amsterdam, the aircraft was old and had no IFE, was a bit disappointing. The meals are very good overall, I loved the Cafe De Paris Chicken. Staff were so so, when I stepped in the plane, the two male FA's who are supposed to welcome people suddenly started chatting, and not welcoming me, not sure what this was about. On another flight they forgot to give me bread with my meal, they serve the bread after the meal I saw them giving other people but they never gave me. I would fly with them again if they have the cheapest ticket to my destination, otherwise not.",Passive

"  I had to get from Amsterdam to Antalya, and in winter time Turkish Airlines seemed to be the only decent option with a daily service. The flight was via SAW, the other airport in Istanbul. AMS-SAW was uneventful and not memorable, except the aircraft was an old A320 with a worn and not very clean cabin. No entertainment system, food offer was decent, but rather below average for an almost 4hr flight, flight attendants busy about themselves. Everything has indicated that the flights from and to SAW is a very low priority for Turkish Airlines. The scheduled transfer time in SAW was 1 hour, however the crowd at the passport control was far too huge to manage this within the time indicated in the reservation. I approached employees of Turkish Airlines and informed them about possible problems with my connection to AYT, and they could not help but tell me that yes, indeed there is no way to pass through the passport control except waiting in the line, then another employee put me on a fast track line, and then another one kicked me out of there explaining that I was not entitled to it. Most of the Turkish Airlines transfer staff also could not speak any English, and those who could had a lot of problems with this. At the end, it took me over 1 hr 30 min to pass through passport control, and I was rebooked to the next flight departing from SAW at 00.10 am instead of initially planned 8.05 pm. On the transfer desk they also gave me a voucher for a meal in McDonalds, the voucher could be redeemed only for the cheapest burger menu worth c.a. EUR 4.5. Needless to say, that is below anything that can be expected from a major air carrier, and I went to another place to get my meal on my own. No free internet in SAW, and the procedure for getting the paid one is crazily complicated. The flight from SAW to AYT was uneventful too, a brand-new B737-800 with a great entertainment system and a good sandwich",Detractor

Then it was kept on hold, as the captain informed us to ""fog"". We landed one hour later than expected and the connection flight for Addis Ababa did not wait for us. During the flight I was asking for information about the departure gate of my connection and no one was able to provide such information. The customer service at the Ataturk Airport was terrible to use a nice expression, nobody could explain what to do and where to go, it took a while to dig the needed information, queuing here and there at desks. I got the information that I could be booked on the next available flight (24 hours later) and that I could get a free night in hotel (I am paying for my hotel in Addis). Past the passport control we had to queue for more than one hour to get to the ""hotel desk"" by Turkish Airlines where staff took our boarding passes and 40 minutes later appeared calling our names and then bringing to get a shuttle to a 5 stars hotel in the middle of nowhere. All this took 4 hours. Here I am now, no dinner, meetings in Addis Ababa rescheduled and one day wasted. Never again.",Detractor

Check in counter agent was rude, refused to maintain eye contact or answer questions regarding change of seats, continued to engage in conversation with the agent at the next counter and when pressed, replied that his English is poor. I had told him that is unacceptable and that he was rude. He had no response and essentially invited me to file a complaint. I did via on line with Turkish Airlines.

"  Moscow Vnukovo to Istanbul return in economy. Online service was a nightmare, the website is not loading properly, aircraft maps were screwed up, which made it impossible to order the seats you want. On the way to Istanbul the flight was delayed for around an hour with no explanation or apology. The aircraft are clean and modern but the seats are narrow and uncomfortable for a relatively short flight. Personal screens are great, but I found the quality of programming and translation to Russian is poor. Meal service was good, with a choice of alcohol, metal cutlery. The beef was delicious and wine was much better than average, though the presentation of the meal was messy. Cabin crew is generally friendly. The worst part was our return trip to Moscow. We have arrived to Istanbul Ataturk airport to check in 2 hours 40 minutes before the flight only to find out that the flight was overbooked, and we might not be able to fly today. Check-in staff was awful, rude and only acknowledged that she put us on standby when I noticed that our boarding passes didn't have a seat number. She would not offer any solution and just rudely told us to go to the gate, so that maybe someone will not arrive and we will board the plane . After we started arguing the Turkish Airlines representative came and started going about how overbooking flights is legal, and the situation is our problem. This is unbelievable. After some more arguing from our side she made some phone calls and told us the plane will be changed to a bigger one, and she printed our boarding passes. No apologies. The flight was uneventful, but the ground staff attitude to the passengers, and inability to solve problems created by Turkish Airlines in a calm and professional manner makes me want to never fly Turkish Airlines ever again.",Detractor

In fact, they have a wide range of sport equipment which one can take for free, however I'm not sure whether you can take it on top of your 32 kg free luggage (or whatever you have if you fly business/first) or whether I just got lucky. I also took on both trips, KUL-VIE and return 3 big pieces of carry on luggage and nobody said anything (although I'm sure this is not their official policy).

If that were not bad enough the next time they said they would be flying was 2 days later on Monday. But it is now Monday and they have had the better part of two days to deal with the snow and the weather is crystal clear in Dushanbe. But is the flight coming on time? No. It is delayed 5.5 hours, assuming it arrives at all. That has destroyed the rest of my itinerary. I am going to have to spend the night in Istanbul as a result in the best case scenario.

"  Bogota to Rome via Istanbul. We booked the tickets back in early October 2016 for the 5 of us, as part of our once-a-year-trip to Germany. The offers with LH for the direct flight BOG-FRA were not interesting at all. Being a Star Gold Card holder I preferred to travel with a Star Alliance partner, and knowing that TK started to serve BOG in May 2016, I looked for this option, but prices to any German destination were still rather high, so for pure curiosity I went searching the prices for other European destinations. Rome with a very attractive price was the hit, so we decided to fly TK via IST to Italy, staying one night in IST and one night in Rome, before heading on to FRA with a very cheap Alitalia ticket. Bogota to Istanbul has a stop-over in Panama City, and the same flight number back to BOG from IST. So when boarding the plane in BOG we found many passengers originating in Istanbul with Panama as their destination. So the plane was packed on the short flight to Panama, with many passenger leaving the plane in PTY, but not too many passengers boarding to fly to Istanbul. This meant that my wife and myself had a row of 2 seats for ourselves on the way over during this long 13h flight. The service offered by crew was faultless, the food was very good and nicely presented, I would say the best I had in Economy so far. The crew was attentive and willing to help in any case. During the long flight my wife flew into her birthday, and I asked if they can do anything for her. They smiled and promised to arrange a surprise. 20 minutes later they came along with the on-board chef, presenting a cake, nicely prepared with candles and cream saying happy birthday, champagne from Business Class for both of us, and singing happy birthday to her! The plane arrived on time in IST, and we went on the City tour Turkish Airlines offers to their international transfer passengers. This tour is free and takes you to the most important tourist sites in Istanbul, and includes a nice lunch. After the tour ended, the guide stayed in the city with those who were not in a hurry, like us, and took us around some more places. Next morning flight to Rome, with a nicely presented and filling breakfast, better than most Intra-European business class meals on other airlines. Trip back to Colombia in January the same quality on all flights, I was a bit concerned about our luggage due to some comments here about lost baggage, but all arrived safely in BOG. During the 6h layover at AtatÃ¼rk airport we used the Turkish Airlines lounge. A huge place, nicely decorated, with great F&B options, nice showers and some other gimmicks like electronic driving range, pool table, etc - a very good place to easily spend the time and get a nice rest before the very long flight back to BOG. That flight was totally packed, nevertheless the crew again offered a great service. I cannot complain about lack of friendliness and professionalism. Saying that, however, we were lucky enough to travel back to BOG a week after the snow chaos at AtatÃ¼rk airport. Things probably would have been different for us if we had travelled some days earlier. Overall we recommend Turkish Airlines.",Promoter

I could only say that this North America flight has gone downhill in last few years. The plane seemed aged, seats were not comfy, narrow for 10 hours flight. It could be my luck getting an older plane, and it could be different with newer planes for the same route. Check-in to the flight was a complete mess. Instead of calling with zones or Tier everyone invited to open counters, and it caused huge line ups and mess in the plane. Cabin staff was nice, courteous but not helpful. They lied about foods to people especially who were not a native speaker of Turkish. They passed, drinks and food items over passengers heads to their colleague if they were out on their carts. I felt extremely warm in my seat. Complained about it and the answer was this is the coldest they can get at this altitude for maximum air quality in the cabin.

Anyway, the boarding was fine, I liked the hot refreshing towel, the cosmetic kit with slippers and socks, the blanket and pillow. The tablet had good resolution so I enjoyed a movie. The catering was great (as always), so were the beverages. We arrived with a 1 hour delay. Apart from long queues at the passport control, which is not the fault of Turkish Airlines, I had to wait another hour for my luggage, which is the airline's handling agency fault.

"  Turkish Airlines is nice when everything goes right. However, if something goes wrong they are really terrible. Case in point, I recently flew from Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. Both flights were delayed by an hour. The onboard service was very good on both legs. Onboard the service is of a higher quality than that of US airlines. However, when we arrived into Dubai, all 3 of our bags were missing. Since both flights were delayed over an hour, there was plenty of time to transfer the bags. However, our bags didn't make it and apparently, neither did the bags of some other passengers who originated from Houston. Believe it or not, after a long flight from Houston to Istanbul, upon arrival you do not arrive at a jetway. You arrive at remote parking and have to take a bus to the terminal. This also has an impact on baggage and for this reason alone, I would not recommend Turkish. The resolution of the baggage has been awful. The only way to communicate with TK is via twitter. 2 of our bags have been found but one seems to be completely gone. In this age of barcode bagtags, I just do not see how this happens. I can't recommend anyone take Turkish Airlines based on my experience. They are horrible when anything goes awry.",Detractor

Then we got earbuds (bad quality and shallow sound but it is economy so I am not going to complain) and I managed to watch a full movie during the flight (the screen was pretty large and had good resolution). The food on this short-haul flight was tasty and it included a hot meal (which is rare on European flights) and a complimentary beverage (I recommend Ayran yoghurt and homemade lemonade but you can also take alcoholic drinks).

"  Rome to Khartoum via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines customer service extremely chaotic and disorganized, the worst flight experience I have ever had. I realize that the bad weather conditions (snow) was out of the airlines control on the night of 6th January in Istanbul, the service and the little information provided by TK was extremely poor and confusing. Soon after we landed in IST, we were informed that all flights were cancelled due to bad weather conditions. There was no clear information or guidance provided and the few (rude) TK staff members present at Ataturk airport seemed not interested / willing to assist passengers about what to do. All we got was wrong information and their ground staff kept sending us from one desk to another. That first night, after 4 hrs spent in the airport to get some information, I decided to go to an hotel paid by myself. The following morning (07 January) we were informed that all flights were cancelled again due to snow and I had to queue almost 7 hrs at the ticketing office to rebook my flight for the next day. In the end, I had to book the accommodation by myself again, as there was another extremely long queue at their hotel information desk. On 08 January, my flight to KRT cancelled again and again 7 hours of queue to rebook the flight. The third day I went to the airport in the morning, this time the flight was confirmed so I checked in and entered the departure area after passport control but the flight to KRT was cancelled once again at about 04.00 PM and again a chaotic queue at the immigration and after another queue at the ticket office to re-change my flight, with no help or guidance from TK staff. After that and after 3 more hours of queue to get an hotel, I managed to have a room only at 04 AM, since we spent time driving around Istanbul looking for a free hotel, since they were all full booked with TK passengers stranded in the city.

But the transfer at Ataturk airport was an absolute disaster. They had snow 4 days before and still had not recover from it. All flights were delayed, the airport was packed, people were sleeping on the floor - complete chaos. Our flight was delayed every hour without any reason, and nobody at the airport could help us, they were rude and useless, couldn't give a damn about any passengers. After 5 long hours of waiting without any help, finally a boarding gate appeared. We rushed there and suddenly this mass of people rushed to the check in counter and the boarding was delayed. Nobody told us what was happening, we couldn't understand because they were speaking in Turkish, but we finally understood that they were trying to get on board because they had been stuck in Istanbul for four days. I thought we would stay stuck as well for days. We boarded the flight in complete chaos, they tried to change our seats that we booked months ago, the entertainment system crashed, and when we arrived the luggage took forever and was wet.",Detractor
"  Ho chi minh city to ZÃ¼rich via Istanbul. Because of snow in Istanbul our flight was re-directed, we landed in Gaziantep and were left alone without any information. Then we were picked up by busses into hotels. Turkish Airlines not reachable, rebooking were not possible. Then after 30 hours one guy came, we began re-booking tickets that were canceled again. We have the feeling Turkish Airline doesn't care. The seats onboard were uncomfortable for me, and the call center agents only friendly in case for selling tickets. I will never book Turkish Airlines again.",Detractor
"  Venice to Singapore via Istanbul. Both aircraft were immaculate (6 months old) and featured the latest Turkish onboard hard product. Despite travelling on the NYE night, flights were packed. As an Elite member, I was upgraded to Business class on the Istanbul to Singapore route. Food remains one of the main strenghts of but I have the feeling portions became smaller (maybe it's just me). Cabin crew nice, especially the cabin chief on the A330. The onboard chef looked a bit confused and inexpert though. The new Denon noise-cancellation hedphones supplied are above what competitors offer in Business. Good quality champagne with generous refills. Took off on-time and landed ahead of schedule. Free Wifi, which worked great until 20 minutes before landing in Singapore.",Promoter
"  Edinburgh to Cape Town via Istanbul. No segregation of business class and economy customers at gate - economy pushed in ahead of the business class customers. No Amenity bag or flat bed on Edinburgh to Istanbul 4hr 25 mins flight. A 3.5 hour delay on the second leg. The business class lounge staff at the front desk are rude and useless and won't give you information. Nice food and wine in the business class lounge but no comfortable day beds or seats that would allow you to recline in comfort. Istanbul to Cape Town rescheduled but at no point shown as boarding on info screens. At boarding we ended up lumped in with economy passengers again. A330 Istanbul to Cape Town a nice new modern plane, flat bed good, Denon headphones supplied, excellent food and wine (although no top-ups offered), staff seemed in a huff (who would not be at 6.30am when flight was due to leave nearly 4 hours prior) and not quite on it. Reluctant service. Only 1 loo for business class and this behind the closely guarded and curtained staff section â€“ you were told to get back behind the curtain if you entered the cabin crew space.",Passive
"  Kuala Lumpur to Istanbul return. The food on the flight was some of the worst. I find the cabin staff can be quite surly. However, had a truly awful experience with their customer service during the return flight, Istanbul was hit by blizzards the afternoon of the evening return flight which caused chaos with cancellations of all flights from all Istanbul airports, unfortunate, not much one can do about the weather. What is deplorable is the experience I have had with their customer service. Given the situation as one can imagine the ticket sales/changes queue at the airport was astronomical with everyone trying to rearrange travel arrangements. Spoke with a THY staff member who said I could rearrange over the phone. Waiting for half an over on the phone reached a customer service representative who informed me that as the KL to Perth flight was with a partner airline and THY they could not complete the booking and I had to go in person to the THY ticket office. So I went to the other airport in Istanbul at 3am in a taxi in a blizzard. Upon arriving at the ticket sales office they said they emailed the partner airline but that we would have to wait for a confirmation response. No indication of time frames. We waited for an hour then a different staff member told us that there was no need for us to wait at the airport and that in fact there was no need for us to have come in person to the airport to do this and the call staff had misinformed us. After getting a few hours sleep I then spent half the day repeatedly calling Turkish Airlines chasing any updates. Eventually I was told that in fact we were on standby with the other airline which was strange as the other airlines website was showing tickets for sale. After tearing my hair out eventually I spoke directly with the original booking travel agent who changed the booking no problem wish I had done that sooner rather than wasting my time with THY. Unfortunately the same issue has happened again with the rebooked flight tonight being cancelled due to weather and I am now going through the entire process again. No one can or will give me a telephone number for the ticket sales office instead I am told that I have to get a taxi, drive an hour each way if I'm lucky in the snow and repeat the crazy process of telling the ticket sales office in person exactly what I've told the call centre for them to lodge the booking request with the other airline and then wait until who knows when for them to get back. I have repeatedly asked to speak to a more senior management staff at the call centre to resolve the issue to be told there is no one more senior. Considering the trip was bought as one continuous flight how on earth THY cannot resolve this from their end with the partner airline beggars belief and why on earth one has to physically go to the ticket office to do this seems illogical and hugely inconvenient.",Detractor
"  Athens to Cape Town via Istanbul. Aircraft were clean but seat pitch was terrible and it was very uncomfortable to sleep. The flight from IST to South Africa was 10hr 15 min and I had very few hours of sleep. On the going flight I had a window seat and it was uncomfortable, on the return flight I selected a row seat to get some sleep but flight attendants knocked my feet with their trolley.

To my surprise, a very well organized boarding procedure by TGS at the gate with recorded announcements offering priority for passengers needing assistance and premium flyers. The A321 with the recliner business seats and the touchscreen IFE (including the handheld controller) offers good comfort for a flight that is shy of 4-hours. Pre departure drinks offered with a smile by the Flying Chef. The amenity pouch handed out also adequate considering the duration of the flight. The onboard catering of high quality. Service also attentive. On time arrival. Doha airport extremely busy. TK could offer a fast track card for arrival immigration, although I was able to use the business lane with my boarding card, it was quite a chaotic process. Excellent overall experience.",Promoter

One thing is that I had problems with choosing seats in advance online but I did not receive useful response through email. Other than that the ground and flight crews have good attitude.",Promoter
"  Gatwick to Singapore via Istanbul, returning from Bangkok. The outward flight delayed by approximately 30mins due to a problem with a wheel. Most of this time was made up during the flight. Seats on narrow body jet quite comfortable with reasonable recline and seat width. In-flight catering very good for a short flight. Stop at Instanbul not so good mainly because of the long distances in a bus from and too planes. Flight to SIN good with flat bed seats. Cabin crew attentive, but with night flight most passengers selpt for much of the flight. Return from BKK to IST equally good. Flight from IST to LGW similar to outward flight but no vegetarian meal available despite having been ordered. I was surprised by the agrressive manner that this was met by the in-flight chef who appeared to claim it was my fault because I had not ordered a vegetarian meal. The senior cabin crew officer was more understanding and noted my concerns (I had been offered vegetarian food on three of the four legs). Later received an email to tell me that when my original booking had been changed, with the flight being changed by 5 mins, the request had not been updated. At least there was an apology. No entertainment system on this flight 'due to a malfunction'. It is small things such as this that separate the best airlines from the average. Turkish Airlines has many strengths but is not sufficiently consistent to be excellent.",Promoter

"  I rarely post reviews, but Turkish airlines deserve a fabulous one. I arrived to Antalya through Istanbul from Lebanon, I was grabbing my baggage and one of the staff approched me to tell me that one of my luggage was broken (something i didnt see), he apologized and proposed two options : money back or a new bag. I chose a new one. I had missed my business flight on my way back to Beirut for whatever reason, one of the staff a girl, was rude and said I have to pay again my ticket. But when I explained the situation to the supervisor on that day, he printed out a new business transfer ticket and replaced the missed one. Not to forget the super luxurious lounge in Ataturk airport, just mind-blowing, and the hours passed fast until my second flight. Thank you so much Turkish Airlines.",Promoter
"  Los Angeles to Johannesburg return via Istanbul. We had a nightmarish time making our reservation with Turkish Airlines. After reservation was made and tickets were issued, airlines unexpectedly change our flight time, flight date and flight number, and this happened several times. It caused us having to change hotel and other reservations several times, and having to stay at some cities longer (or shorter). Turkish Airlines also did not notify us or the travel agent about the changes. We were lucky enough to find out only because we were making online seat selections They even moved flight #4 in our travel plan earlier than #3, meaning we would arrive in one city, only to find the next flight we were supposed to catch had already left a few days ago. As for the flights themselves, they were ok. Service was ok, a bit inconsistent on some flights. Some planes were older, others are newer. Cabins and bathrooms were clean, seats were comfortable. Food were enjoyable, although quality was a little inconsistent too. In Turkey airports, you do get special privileges for flying with Turkish Airlines Business Class, so that is something to consider if flying to Turkey.",Passive

"  Manila via Istanbul to Munich . Boarding started 30min later than announced on boarding pass. I asked myself in Istanbul the guy at the gate and got as response that the announced times are merely scheduled times. Seats were okay but nothing special. Strange was the existance of a middle seat in business class on the 777, with zero privacy to the neighbor. Crew was friendly but do not expect refilling of drinks without asking. After dinner you get a bottle of water - if you need more until breakfast you pick it up yourself. Food was good, dessert excellent. Drink selection OK, but I had to beg for alcoholic drinks. Onboard entertainment was very good on the 777, not on the A321. Announcements were kept to a minimum. I would rate the experience below average.",Detractor
"  Bodrum to Istanbul. While the ground staff at the Domestic IST CIP terminal are great in reserving front rows or exit seats for their premium Miles&Smiles members, unfortunately, the TGS ground staff in BJV are the opposite. When I asked politely if I could have a window seat towards the front of the cabin I was handed a boarding card with a seat in the last row with a grin. I then asked if I could do a last minute mileage upgrade. Was first told that it was no problem, then the counter agent contacted her supervisor/colleague which first said that there was availability and that she could process my request but then strangely asked for my name, I could hear the whole conversation over the radio. I guess unless you are a local VIP your commercial value is of little importance. Then suddenly a barrage of invalid excuses followed. First she suggested that my fare class did not allow a last minute upgrade, when I pointed out that was untrue, it was unavailabllity bucket class C, which is also untrue according to M&S rules, finally she said there was a problem with their system, a TGS classic, I was handed out a seat in 6A and did not pursue the matter any further as a line began to form behind me. Not that of a big problem for a 50 minute flight but having had worse problems before, I was reminded once more how TK's ground services and customer service attitude on the ground, bar TK Do&Co, is a total mess. The flights to BJV and to IST were excellent in the air. On time, friendly and attentive cabin crew and detailed flight deck announcements. I wish it was good on the ground as it is in the air.",Passive

"  In September 2016 I had a horrible experience with Turkish Airlines. My flight (TK-476) was on 17/09 from Ekaterinburg (Russia) to Barcelona via Istanbul. The time of departure was supposed to be at 7.30 - arriving time to Istanbul at 10.15 and the departure to BCN at 14.40 - so having 4.25 hours would be more than enough to change the plane in Istanbul. Unfortunately the Turkish Airlines delayed the flight in Russia for more than 3 hours. I can understand that there might be some technical problems or something but in that case the company is supposed to ""think"" of its passengers and be more client-oriented which I haven't noticed. The representatives didn't give any explanations regarding the reasons of delay, time of the flight, food, etc. When we finally arrived to Istanbul we still had enough time to catch the plane to BCN (we had 1 hour before the flight) and they could delay the plane for 15-20 min to let us in (I was not the only passenger - we were like 20 people who found themselves in this situation). The only thing they said was ""sorry, you have to wait for the next plane"" (additional 5 hours of waiting). They ignored us and our questions. After that I asked for food and I was given some sort of a coupon which was possible to use only in some places in food court. The cheapest ones, as I realized later. So the only thing I managed to have using this coupon was a bottle of water. Therefore sitting in Istanbul airport waiting for the plane for 5 hours I had to spend my money on normal food in a normal place. For the information: before that in Russia I was waiting for 3 hours and nobody informed me about breakfast so again I had to spend my money on food there. My advice to Turkish Airlines: teach your employees how to communicate with clients and to be more client-oriented.",Detractor

"  Vilnius to Buenos Aires via Istanbul. A next-to-perfect experience. VNO-IST a new 737, light load in business, crew attentive. No printed menu, yet good food and a large choice of beverages. In Istanbul, a separate shuttle for business pax getting them to the terminal before the main crowd. Got a complimentary 5* hotel for my layover, yet had to wait for almost an hour before it was arranged (without any crowd at the desk). Another negative point for ground service - staff at Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul was unable to handle any reservation change, been told to go to transfer desk (which is in the arrivals area and would thus need to re-clear security to get back to departures). Istanbul to Buenos Aires a slightly worn Boeing 777, yet full recline seat. Great attentive staff, printed menu, food was great and plentiful - two full services, one light (sandwiches) plus an ample choice of self-service items. Despite a dedicated wine list being presented, had to explicitely request wine, crew never offered it. Free wifi for business passengers is a great plus as well, although the connection was faltering at some moments. Onboard experience was thus almost spotless, ground experience much less so - at Buenos Aires, first priority/business luggage was delivered more than 20 minutes after the delivery started. Fellow business pax already started to worry. On the overall, a very nice experience, outstanding value for money given the price paid.",Promoter

Soft skills, understanding of Service and how tired a passenger can be is not the concern of employees. Star Alliance passengers also patronize this lounge which makes it super crowded. Boarding is another mess ground staff creates group to ease the boarding, however it doesnt help at all. Many economy class passengers use Business class lane and this is acceptable by staff.

My complaint is with their Customer service which is abysmal. I needed to delay my departure because my Father-in-law was very ill. They had no Customer Service in India. I called their HQ and even though I selected the English option, they continued to talk in Turkish. I then called the US office (might as well). They gave a price 3 times my original fare just to change the dates ($2000 per ticket - my original fare was $850). To top it all, they will not accept credit cards.

If you try to rebook a flight or do your online check-in on the old version the programme will send you into nirvana.

For the online check-in we tried the Taksim Square office again which turned out to be closed but we were fortunate enough to find out there is another office nearby at Harbiye where the nice and helpful TK staff was able to assign our seats but not to print out our boarding passes - TK, an airline full of mystery.

The TK lounge is big and offers a lot, it is so crowded now that it has no premium feel about it - you feel stuck in a crowded noisy bus station. The wifi service is a joke and keeps disconnecting probably from the too large number of people trying to use the service. The planes used to Bogota were old A330s with the old style business class seats which meant no lie flat beds on a 15 hour flight. The crew (it happened to be the same crew on the flight out and back) spoke very little English and semed almost robotic in their behaviour.

Outbound flight was an awful experience on a codeshare flight flying with Royal Air Maroc, I can't believe TK put their flight number to such a product.

The check in experience was relatively easy at Casablanca airport, with no option to fast track at passport control despite the level of Star Alliance membership. Lounge at Casablanca is always busy and offers sandwiches and some hot food sometimes. Flight itself was not a good experience. It is almost a 5 hour flight and the inflight entertainment did not work. The cabin crew were very indifferent and told me there was nothing they could do about it.

"  Istanbul to Almaty return both flights on an old 737-800 rather than normal 737-900 I have experienced on this route before. Outbound flight is an overnight flight and the meal is served early in the flight allowing passengers to sleep for the rest of the journey. Experience was OK apart from the comfort of the seat. Legroom was great as I was in an exit seat, but the seat is very hard which is very uncomfortable for a 5 hour journey. The return flight some days later was on an identical (maybe the same) aircraft. A hot breakfast (that was actually very cold) was served at the beginning of the 6 hour return flight followed by some drinks a few hours later. For such a long journey I would expect a light refreshment to be served towards the latter part of the flight and a hotter meal. On both flights most of the crew were very indifferent and non-caring towards passengers with the exception of some who appeared to be from Kazakhstan who seemed to be smiling and helpful. On descent into Ataturk Airport water started to stream out of the ceiling (perhaps from melting ice) of the plane onto me and the passenger in front of me. We were both seated in exit row seats by the window. It was not possible to get out of my seat at this time as we were so close to landing so I had to use pillows and blankets to cover myself from the water. Due to a bird strike incident with the plane in front of us we had to ascend sharply to make another landing approach. We flew for a further ten minutes before landing safely. Pilot communication during this incident was very acceptable which was pleasing. I advised the flight attendant on exiting about the water leak and my clothing she told me that this sometimes happens - very poor attitude towards customer. In future I'll probably consider another carrier for this route. I was surprised TK use such an older plane on such a long journey and the attitude of their cabin crew.

"  Zurich to Bogota via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines might be the best in Europe due to their good product between Istanbul and European cities but their hard product on long haul routes is very outdated and horrendous. Especially on the A330-200. The planes are old, dirty and the seats often broken. To top it off, the inflight enterntainment did not work on a 13 hour flight. An airline should be consistent and offer the same hard product in C-class across their entire fleet. Their flight attendants are brash and lack the professionalism of other airlines in Star Alliance. I find the food very over-rated, in fact almost everything is almost tacky, starting from the presentation of the menu to the dinner service with the fake candle. This airline lacks the ""finesse"" of its biggest European competitors. When I asked my seat neighbour, who hails from Eastern Europe and now lives in Panama, why he doesn't fly with other airlines, his answer was simply ""I like the price"".

However, the customer service is terrible, I can remember 4-5 terrible interactions with airline staff in various occasions (flight attendants, airport staff, ticketing). Ataturk Airport, is not well-equipped. You won't have access to even wifi. I do not recommend this airline if you're going to have a long connection time at that airport. All in all, the airline provides OK services. If you find a very affordable and temping price, it's worth it.",Detractor
"  Istanbul to Gatwick. Some new healthier food options at the lounge much appreciated. Both Gozen Security and TGS at the gate implemented priority for families and Status/J Pax. Organized boarding and on time departure. I have been getting consistently 737s or A321s with 2x2 seating on this route which is the best European business hard product. The IFE had the latest blockbusters and the interactive 3D flight map. The food was well presented and tasty, enjoyed the swordfish brochette, though the portions seem to have gotten a little smaller. The crew and the onboard Chef were proactive and smiling. Arrived ahead of schedule and was on the Gatwick Express in less than 30 minutes. When things go well, TK really is the best in Europe.",Promoter

"  A direct flight from Dublin to Istanbul, which is often used for connections onwards to Asia or Africa, but this was solely for the purpose of visiting Istanbul. Turkish Airlines have gathered a very good reputation for themselves and this flight was no exception. The planes were extremely clean, the flight was on time, staff friendly and the entertainment very good. The food was also very nice, and is something they have been trying to constantly improve â€“ they even make an air steward(ess) dress like a chef for the duration of the flight! Turkish delights handed out on take-off, as well as warm towels prior to landing. My only issue was with the price which was higher than average, but that was purely driven by the time of the flight (school holiday season). Classy airline due to their very satisfactory economy class service.",Promoter
Istanbul to Washington IAD with Turkish Airlines. I tried to obtain an status match with another Star Alliance partner.

"  Flew from Vienna to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. On the positive side, food is excellent, service is attentive and overnight on long distance is a good as it can get on a plane. Transit in Istanbul has been reported as problem by numerous passengers. This is due to outsourcing to TAS Turkish Airport Services which is not part of TK. TK has made efforts to make transit as pleasant as possible in IST, such as allowing transit passengers to access the departure level without going through security control again and providing the most fabluous lounge in the world. If you have a jetty for departure, boarding is a very orderly process. Problems arise when there is no jetty and passengers just scramble into a shuttle. Bagage transit has worked very well even on occasions of short connection. On the negative side TK has grown too fast and also outgrown the available facilities at Ataturk Airport.",Promoter
"Hannover to Dubai via Istanbul. Once again a quite good experience. All 4 flights in time, in two cases landing ahead of schedule. Check in took a bit long in Hannover, and I wonder why online check in is provided but no baggage drop counter. Aircraft all clean, crew was friendly and food for economy class was good. Enterntainment system ok, just the provided headphones are not very comfortable. Transfer in Istanbul on both ways efficient. Can recommend Turkish Airlines, not sure if they are Europes number one but for sure they are among the best.",Promoter
"  This is the first time we have flown with Turkish Airlines and it was superb. Check in was quick and easy as was the priority fast track and boarding. On board the first flight the crew were friendly, helpful and attentive. The seats wide and comfortable and the food and wines excellent. The lounge in Istanbul was large but with plenty of seating and a wide choice of freshly cooked food and snacks. Not that we ate having had a delicious lunch. We boarded the plane to Mauritius and were immediately impressed by the welcome, the cleanliness and the comfort of the cabin. Straight after take off the Chef (yes they have an on board chef) came round with the dinner menu. Pre dinner drinks were served with small bowls of nuts and olives to be followed by a variety of hot and cold canapÃ©s served from the trolley. Our tray tables were beautifully set and dinner was served with all the little extra chefs touches just like in a first class restaurant. After an truly wonderful meal the cabin crew asked could they make up our beds. A bed pack was produced with mattress pillows and duvet. Our seats then became fully flat beds and I had a restful night. Having already chosen our breakfast we were wakened to yet another lovely meal. Arrival was on time and our baggage arrived quickly We had the same experience on our return flights nothing was too much trouble for the excellent staff. Having travelled to Mauritius many times in British Airways business class and experienced the scruffy aircraft and the lack of service, travelling with Turkish Airlines was a breath of fresh air much more @like being-in first class. I cannot recommend Turkish Airlines highly enough and look forward to travelling with them again. Turkish Airlines deserves 5*.",Promoter
"  Bangkok to Venice via Istanbul. New planes on both legs with the latest hard product, excellent food as usual.

"Service on board was excellent, perhaps in part due to the fact that the business cabin was at most half occupied. The flight from Chicago to Istanbul is a evening/night flight, so we were first served a dinner and then the flight attendants made up the lie-flat bed. One really has to commend Turkish for the excellent, restaurant quality food they serve on board. Also a good selection of beverages. Flight attendants provided excellent service. One negative which I experienced last year with Turkish as well. On landing in IST, we did not dock at a gate, but parked out on the tarmac, which means one has to walk down stairs and then take a bus to the terminal. This is really unacceptable for a major international flight.",Promoter
"  Dar es Salaam to London via Istanbul. I was on an overnight flight from Dar es Salaam departing at 03.25 to arrive at Attaturk Airport at 10.25 later that morning. The plane was an old model and the seats did not recline completely. Sleep was not easy. One of the stewardess's in the business section could barely speak English, was unable to make herself understood and spent a lot of time opening & shutting overhead compartments in the business section, making it difficult for me to sleep (I was in seat 2B). My problem arose at Attaturk Airport when, only having a 2 hour layover, I chose to go to the business class lounge to relax until the connecting flight to London. However, I fell asleep and woke 20 minutes before take off. What I hadn't realised was that the gate was a 25 minute walk from the lounge and though I ran I made it to the gate only to be told the gate had closed, that I would need to go to the information desk to get another ticket for an alternative flight to London. When asked for instructions to the information desk, I was given incorrect information as to how to get there. Every member of the ground staff I asked told me a different direction, and were most unhelpful. Eventually I was told I needed to go to the transfer department - again given incorrect directions. Finally when I spoke to a member of staff there, he told me I had to go to the ticket office as he could not issue a ticket for me. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the ticket office. Back to information, who told me I had to go through passport control. When I got there I was told I needed a visa. Why? After all I'm airside, I'm not leaving the airport - no one had the courtesy to tell me that the only place I could buy a new ticket was outside the transit area. Again, I was given incorrect directions to the visa desk. I purchased a visa that cost me Â£20, went through passport control and eventually managed to find the ticket office. Again, I was met by very surly ticket office sales staff who were most unhelpful and who tore up my boarding pass & suggested I would have to pay a further Â£1050 for a business class ticket or Â£435 for a single economy ticket. She suggested if I wanted to try to buy one cheaper, I could do so online. When asked what the Wi-Fi code was, I was told there wasn't any. Having no alternative but to buy the economy ticket, I was then told to go to the incorrect check in desk! Standing in line for ages, when I got to the desk, I was told I had to go to 'C' section. Finally I came across the one and only helpful staff member, who understood my predicament, was sympathetic and helped me through the process of locating my luggage (which had obviously been off loaded from the original aircraft I was supposed to be on) and assured me it would be on the flight I was now booked on. I was aware that I had a restricted ticket and would therefore forfeit the ticket for a no show, or cancellation etc, however, what I did not expect was the rudeness and unhelpfulness from Turkish Airlines ground staff. I certainly would never book with Turkish Airlines again. It was a nightmare.",Detractor
"  Birmingham to Cape Town via Istanbul and Durban. BHX to IST a comfortable B737-800 with fairly good leg space. Food was okay. Cabin crew weren't very enthusiastic. IFE was a bit difficult to work as touch screen wasn't very responsive. Choice of movies was okay. Was shocked to see many passengers get up to collect their cabin luggage while plane was still taxiing on arrival in Istanbul and cabin crew did nothing except tell them to sit down over the speaker. Istanbul to Cape Town via Durban a new A330-300, much better IFE although seat would not recline and very uncomfortable for a 12 hour flight to CPT, including a 1 hour layover in Durban. Fortunately we did not have to disembark in Durban. Food quality was the same as previous flight. Appreciated the amenities (toothbrush, socks.etc) given on this long haul flight as this is not always provided for on other airlines. Cabin crew friendlier on this sector. Flight was punctual on arrival in CPT. Return flight CPT-IST via Durban on an A330-300. More experienced crew and friendlier than previous flights. Same food quality and almost exactly same menu. IST to BHX on a B737-800. Boarding was disorganized and painfully slow which caused a slight delay in the flight. Lack of adequate airport facilities at Istanbul a contributing factor. Same breakfast served as on previous flight. Overall, not a great experience but considering it was cheapest ticket available I accept the outcome. Service and product quality nowhere near as advertised. Food menu was repetitive on all flight and cabin crew not always professional with not very fluent English.",Detractor
"  Johannesburg to Montreal via Istanbul. Check in at JNB was uneventful. Turkish Airlines uses the SAA lounge which is pretty ordinary but food choices are extensive. Boarding was delayed due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft but was conducted in an orderly manner. Onboard, the aircraft looked well kept and the FA's were friendly and spoke very good English. Food and wine quality were good but I would have liked to have a few South African wines. Dinner and drink service was very slow and it took us over three hours to get to desert once we were airborne. The aircraft on the JNB-IST leg did not have wifi and although the IFE had a large selection of movies, it was on the skinny side when it came to new releases. Flight landed on time and with almost every flight we were bussed to the terminal. Spent a few hours in the Istanbul lounge which is well and truly an amazing experience with a very large array of food and beverage offerings. Boarding on the second leg was absolutely chaotic and TK should be ashamed of putting their premium passengers through that ordeal. Once again we were bussed to the aircraft. The second A330 was brand new and the crew and their service were outstanding. I felt pampered throughout the 10 hour flight and was able to catch 3 hours of very comfortable rest in the lie flat seats. The WiFi on the second leg did not work despite the pursers countless efforts to get it up and running. The food on the second leg was superior to the first which likely was related to catering being done out of TK's hub in Istanbul. The flight landed on time but the luggage delivery was slow with priority bags coming out towards the end. Turkish offers a very good business class product on long-haul routes and I would not hesitate to use them again. They must however improve boarding and gate arrangements in IST which are deplorable.",Promoter
"Venice to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul, first flight an overbooked A321 flight. As an Elite member, I was upgraded to Business class at the gate. I appreciate the 2-2 Business class configuration Turkish Airlines has on most of their A321s. It makes the difference compared to other European carriers. Meals were gorgeous as usual, champagne generously available. The chef on board was nice and attentive, otherwise service was a bit rushed. Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur on a new A330-300. Quite low load factor on this segment, I had the chance to take two emergency seats all for myself. Service in general very good, had a long chat with cabin crew at the back of the plane, they seemed nice and friendly.

Sao Paulo to Bangkok via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. In the last 3 weeks they have changed our flights 5 times with just an email notification. No change to connecting flights so if I didn't call there would be no connecting flight. Their customer service act like they are doing you a favour by changing flights. No response to a complaint made via the internet 2 weeks ago. I have used over 20 airlines and this company appears to be the Fawlty Towers of airlines. First and last time I book with them. It takes over one month to receive a refund if you don't want to change flight times every few days. I believe you have to call Turkey for this to hopefully happen.,Detractor
"  Heathrow to Antalya via Istanbul. I booked our flight with Turkish Airlines months in advance. Flight times changed and I made to contact to customer services (cannot be done on their website) to book the new time schedule. I had great trouble to understand their English. Once you book your tickets, you need to fill a form called APIS, to be able to check in and print the boarding pass. We tried this online many times, it got to a point that I wanted to cancel the flights. I had to contact their customer services but again, no luck to talk to anyone who can speak English clearly. We travelled to the airport to sort the problem and book our seats. Our flight was delayed 2 hours, found out at the airport. This caused further problem as we had a transfer flight from Istanbul to Antalya. We were dumped at the Istanbul Ataturk airport, no one there to tell us where to go or what to do. I speak Turkish so we could find our way and helped others. We needed to pass security points, walked almost 1 hour to get to the international to domestic side. But the domestic flight delayed too and we arrived there at 12:35 midnight to find that one of the luggage was left in Istanbul. We waited until 1:45 at their customer services to be told that it was not their problem, it was Istanbul. After long discussion we were told that they would send our luggage the next day. We waited all day for the luggage to arrive. It arrived at night and we wasted a day. I rather use a budget airline and avoid this airline.",Detractor
"Amman to Toronto via Istanbul. Going to Amman meant a 10 hours stop over and then back to Toronto a 9.45 hour stop over, both ways we flew business which should mean a hotel or at a 2 hour room in the business lounge where you can catch a nap and a shower. Both ways we were refused hotel or a 2 hour room. We were not alone - the same was happening to people flying to and from Johannesburg. It seems Turkish Airlines are offering flights with long stop overs and not giving the consumers the option of shorter stop overs then trapping them at Istanbul airport. This airport has some of the most over inflated duty free shops I've ever seen. Research the flights carefully even though Turkish Airlines are not offering shorter stop overs when puting your from and to destinations, there are and people are being forced to spend more than half a day in Istanbul airport. This is not right. I've been travelling 8 hours and still another 8 hours before catching a 14 hour flight to Canada.",Detractor

"  Kilimanjaro to London Heathrow via Istanbul. My route on the way to Tanzania wasn't too bad, although my friends bag did get lost. On the way home it was a terrible 24 hours. We got to Kilimanjaro airport early and then when it came to check in three people from my group including myself weren't on the list to fly! We had to wait till after check in had closed for someone to drive to the airport with a different list, during this time we were told nothing we had no idea if we would definitely be on that flight. We finally got through and then very quickly had to go through security again and wait to board. We had a two hour wait even though our plane had arrived - we got given no information. I hadn't had a drink in over 4 hours due to the fact you can't take liquids into the airport and then the only place I could buy a drink I was only there for a minute until I had to move again into somewhere we couldn't take liquids. They had moved some people up to business class and then after about an hour took in everyones tickets and got them reprinted, back to economy. Finally once we were on and then arrived at Istanbul, due to the fact we were 2 hours late one of my friends travelling with us had missed her next flight. Throughout the whole journey she was asking for help, she was literally on the back seat of the plane and wouldn't allow her to be one of the first to get off so she was the last person off. We then had to wait for a bus to take us to the airport. Once there we tried to find someone to help her, she asked someone who sent her to somewhere you go if you didn't have a boarding pass - this wasn't the issue (causing her to be even later). We asked 5 people at the airport for help and the staff were all rude saying 'I'm busy' and walking off. Eventually we found someone who told her where to go but it was too late she had missed her flight. I then got on my next plane to Heathrow, once landed at 4.30 I went to collect my luggage, I waited an hour and a half for them to then say 'That's all the bags.' Which meant 6 out of 7 people I was with didn't have their rucksacks. We all went over to lost luggage and there we got told all our bags weren't on the flight and that they were on the next flight coming from Istanbul. If we had been told this earlier it wouldn't have been as big an issue yet we waited an hour and half and parking at an airport isn't cheap! There was no communication at all. We got told we could wait till the next flight came in which was gone 9 in the evening or get our bags delivered to us in a few days. I opted for getting my bag delivered as my parents would have had to pay a fortune on parking else. Not happy at all, such a long tiring day with no communication.

"  Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Check-in was handled by a ground agent and not a Turkish Airlines staff. It was a little slow as I wanted my bag checked only to Istanbul and not my final destination. Turkish uses an affiliated lounge in Montreal which was packed with standing room only so I left and walked over to the Air Canada lounge which was very quiet. Boarding was slow with business and coach passengers processed at the same time but through different queues. On top of it, passengers were kept waiting in the jetway as the crew was not ready. Onboard the aircraft looked newish. The FA's were courteous and spoke decent English. The lie-flat seat was comfortable but narrow and the crew turned into a bed by using a mattress and duvet. Service was prompt and food and beverages including champagne were of high quality. IFE had a rich selection of movies and the screen was a decent size. Wi-Fi connectivity was great.

"  On 16th July, some hours after the coup attempt in Turkey, I went to the Munich airport expecting that my flight to SFO with a stop in Istanbul would be cancelled, but for my surprise, at the check-in I was informed by the Turkish Airline staff that the situation in Turkey was normal and that my flight from Istanbul to San Francisco was confirmed. So I got the flight to Istanbul but the situation I found at the airport was terrible. A lot of flights were cancelled. I found out that my flight to SFO was delayed by 5 hours, so I went to the gate and waited there. Then, after 5 hours waiting, they announced that all flights on that day were cancelled and asked passengers to go out of the terminal and ask for a hotel in the Turkish Airlines desk. I went out of the airport but my luggage was not in the baggage carrousel. I went to the hotel desk and they asked everybody there to enter in a bus and we were taken to a hotel. There a Turkish Airlines staff told me that my luggage will be delivered to the hotel and that my flight to SFO was confirmed to the next day. At the next day, we discovered that all flights from Turkey to USA were cancelled and we should wait another day. At the second, the flight was again cancelled, so I was given the option to return to Munich and request a refund of the flight to SFO. So I returned to Munich, but my luggage was lost (they didn't deliver it at the hotel as promised). I filed a report for lost baggage at my arrival at the Munich airport on 18th July and as instructed, I opened a complaint on the Turkish Airlines site on 25th July. Since then I didn't receive any response (40 days without any contact!). I tried to contact the company by telephone, e-mail or via their feedback system, but nothing.

The ground TGS staffs at business check-in counter at SAW airport has poor or no English knowledge and not communicating / speaking at all. TK should standardize the product and service and should offer and have in all airplanes same business and/or economy seats.

"  Niamey to London Heathrow via Istanbul. What a hectic night. We sat on the plane on the tarmac for two and a bit hours because they lost an oxygen tank and couldn't find a new one. They then cancelled our flight and stuck us back in the terminal. Then the heavens opened. Obviously the best option was to stick 200 grumpy passengers outside in the thunder, lightning and rain. Next, they took us 4 at a time in taxis to an hotel. My wife and I were put into what appeared to be the remnant of a much hated Toyota Corrolla. We hung out there for a bit with a guy who spoke no English whatsoever. Once he left us alone in his car and we realised we were going nowhere we accosted a man with a Turkish airlines jacket in a dark car park (still raining). He put us on a bus which proceeded to tour Niamey at 3:00am with the AC on full blast which helped our wet cloths become much more effective in helping us contract some illness. Finally after messing about for a total 6 hours, at 4:00am we got a hotel which makes faulty towers look like New York's Waldorf hotel. There we were left in the hands of the Receptionist. What he lacked linguist ability and clarity of speech he made for in volume and repetition. Needless to say information about our fate was lacking. At around around 7:30am a rumour spread that our suffering may end by 8:00pm that evening. Finally at 8:00pm we were herded into a bus and taken to the airport. There, the Turkish Airlines staff directed us to line up and walk around Niamey airport. At the departure gate our boarding passes and baggage tags were handed out. Once we finally boarded the aircraft most of us passed out with exhaustion for the rest of our journey. Needless to say this is a journey we will not forget in a hurry.",Detractor
"  Booked a flight from Bologna to Los Angeles via Istanbul. First flight was cancelled because of the coup.

As we arrive at the airport we learn all flights to USA have been cancelled again. We go to the ticket sales where a woman finds us a new flight from Istanbul to Frankfurt and a Lufhtansa flight from Frankfurt to LAX, the day after again. One more night in Istanbul. At the check-in counter I'm told they can't check us in for both flights, ""Because we are two different companies"". They say we have to get the luggage back in Frankfurt and check-in again with Lufthansa. Luggage is not in Frankfurt, I ask for information at the baggage claim and they explain to me when luggage is in transit it's kept in transit 'til the final destination. We move to the departures terminal and check-in again, but there's no seat number on the boarding pass. As we arrive at the gate we find out that the Turkish Airlines employee had jut put us on a waiting list. Boarding refused. We go back to the TK ticket sales and after two hours they manage to find us a new flight for the day after. We ask for our luggage, as we have been wearing the same clothes for 3 days and we find out the luggage is not in Frankfurt at all, as it's been never loaded on our flight from Ataturk. We make a claim (fortunately the German personnel is far more professional than the personnel in Ataturk). They say the luggage will be sent to LAX with the next flight from Ataturk. The day after we finally fly to LAX with a LH flight. Luggage is not there. Another claim, they say to come back the day after because TK made another mistake and sent the luggage to Frankfurt.

"  We flew from Los Angeles to Geneva via Istanbul. Flight from LAX to IST was full and while the catering, inflight entertainment and cabin staff service were good, the impression that remained from this flight was the lack of leg room for such a long haul flight. I'm 1m 80 and my wife 1m 76, which has nothing exceptional in the European population and despite having removed all brochures from the seat pockets in front of us, our knees in a normal seating position were touching the seats in front of us (that were not even inclined). We battled during this 12h30 flight to find the most confortable position without success. A real pity that TK accomodate maximum seats in Economy despite very good 9 seats abreast configuration on this 777-300 (vs 10 for many other airlines). Like many European travelers, we have been attracted to Turkish Airlines by their competitive prices (around 50% cheaper than AF, BA, LH, LX when we booked to the ticket early April), their enviable reputation of Best European Airline by Skytrax for several years in a row and their staff reliability (no strikes recorded during the last few years compare to AF/LH for instance). Transit via IST was OK while extremely crowded highlighting again the dramatic need for TK to operate from the new airport under construction. Flight from IST to GVA was fine (A320) without leg room issues). Ground service was inexistant during the transit and we were finally all packed at Gate 306 with no seating capacity available at the boarding gate given the crowd.",Detractor

And it was. The airport was closed (we were the last flight in) and the military coup was in progress. Since there was absolutely no information coming from the airport or Turkish Airlines personnel we had to rely on rumors and twitter to discover what was going on. In short order, here are the events as they unfolded: No personnel from Turkish Airlines was to be seen or heard from in any form from 11pm July 15th until 2pm July 16. They left thousands of transit passengers stranded without food, water or information. No information whatsoever was at any time given to us before the following day 2pm. The transfer desk and information desk was at all times left unmanned. After 14 hours my flight was cancelled. Over the speakers we were given the option to either travel to Turkish Airlines HQ in Istanbul city centre, or call their call center (all lines busy). It was complete chaos. I ended up having to go online and buy a new one-way ticket out of Istanbul. Travel Tip: Find another airline.",Detractor
"  I flew from Munich - Istanbul and back. I think, Turkish Airlines are in fact the best European Airline. I also fly a lot with LH or KLM/AF (in Economy). You can't compare them with TK. The airplane seemed to be new. Both flights were with an A321. On both ways, there was IFE with a large choice of different international movies and documentaries. Never seen this before on an A321 or/and on short-haul. The flight time was enough to watch one movie. However, When you watched a movie and had your earphones on, the cabin announcements were so loud. Food was delicious. At first you get a turkish delight. For the meal, you could choose between Turkish meat-balls and something with chicken. I had the meat-balls which was great. Alcoholic drinks were free. I took a beer and a freshly squeezed orange juice. The staff were nice. Seat comfort is ok. I'm 5ft. 10in. I had enough space to the front and for my legs. The space to my neighbour was fine. I highly recommend TK even in economy class.",Promoter
"  I often fly Turkish Airlines economy class, but this time I flew business class Istanbul-Riga-Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is my favorite airline, but business class exceeded all my expectations. In Istanbul Ataturk airport I could check-in and use the business class passage for migration/security control - which is very valuable in such a busy and crowded airport. Moreover, Turkish Airlines lounge is free of charge for business class passengers. The seats in the business class are wide and comfortable with ability to transform a seat to bed-like resting position. The in-flight entertainment is wonderful - from many new movies, channels, series, etc. Inflight service is excellent with very attentive flight attendants. The meal service was simply fantastic - bext to appetizers, there is a selection of 3 possible main course choices (but I did not like any of them (veal, shrimp, vegetarian), so I was offered extra choice of chicken - to my own surprise). I highly recommend this airline even with economy clas, and its business class is a delight.",Promoter
  Istanbul to Zurich. Lounge and fast track access at IST convenient and at a high standard. Ground services provider TGS also on good behavior. On time boarding with priority implemented for families and status/business Pax. Warm greeting by crew and informative announcement from the flight deck in good English. Proper 2x2 business class seats with on demand IFE and a wide range of content. The 3-course onboard catering very good as usual. Cabin crew could be a little more proactive with refills. Landed ahead of schedule at ZRH. Turkish Airlines is providing a very competitive product and premium product compared to other European Carriers.,Promoter
"  Istanbul to Odessa. Turkish Airlines are a godsend if you need to get to Yemen or Kyrgyzstan. They have a relatively new fleet of planes and an amazing business lounge at Istanbul. However I must warn that this veneer of modernity can disappear quickly if you have any travel issues whatsoever. Lying beneath the surface is a bureaucratic organization and your connection through Istanbul will not be like your connection through Munich. Surly staff, grimy bathrooms, and general discomfort. If you miss a flight and have to stay overnight, you may have the full Turkish experience. So, if you need to get to Tehran in a hurry, Turkish is your best choice.",Detractor
Flew from Tokyo Narita to Malaga via Istanbul. Flight departure was 2230 but at the airport I was told the fight was leaving at 2200. Narita is very far from the town so people arrive early anyway. Flight time was longer so maybe they were anticipating head winds. Very friendly and hard working crew on a full flight. There was a lot of turbulence with the crew having to sit for a lot of it but the cabin atmosphere was very calm. I have no complaints at all about Turkish Airlines onboard service but the IST ground handling staff let them down as they are miserable and unfriendly (NRT of course where good but that is Japanese customer service).,Promoter
"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Miami to Istanbul. Positive things were: the plane looked really nice, every passenger has a screen in front of him/her with a lot of movies, the drinks are free. Negative things were: there isn't enough space for your legs when you are 185 cm tall and the food was not good enough (taste, variety).",Passive

At the gate it appeared that they printed the wrong boarding pass for us which complicated security for us and caused us to lose the bassinet seat after all of this. Now we had to suffer a 13-hour flight separate from each other and with no bassinet to put the baby in.",Detractor
"  My flight was from Nuremberg to Istanbul with an A321. The flight was a great experience for me. The good start was when I was informed that the airline upgrade itself my seat from economy to business class. I was surprised. When I first got in the aircraft I observed that the Business cabin room was great. There are 2 seats in every side instead of the 3x3 (with a vacant seat in the middle) which is the average. The seat space was quite comfortable, the meal was tasty and I also enjoyed the beverages (fresh orange juice, a home-made lemonade and a glass of white wine).

"  Our flight was one of the first out of Istanbul to the United States (to Washington) after the coup attempt of July 15. I was expecting some disarray on the ground and in the cabin but everything went smoothly. I wanted to write this review to express my gratitude to the cabin crew. The flight was TK0177 on July 19, 2016. This group of attendants were the best I have encountered in a long time, on all the flights I took in the last few years. They were eager to make our experience a pleasant one and they succeeded. Their service was efficient with a smile, and with great attention to detail. I am happy with Turkish Airlines in general but what makes it exceptional is the existence of such employees that elevate boring and long flights to outright enjoyable.",Promoter
"  I had a return flight Brussels-Dakar via Istanbul. I got my flight Brussels-Istanbul on 15 July. However, due to the political situation in Turkey, my flight Istanbul-Dakar on 16 July was cancelled and I was stuck at Ataturk Airport. After queuing for 7h30, I was informed there would be no flight to Dakar for the next three days and was sent to another desk. After another 1h I was informed there was a flight to Dakar the day after, but the boarding flights were printed with mistakes. On 17 July, Turkish Airlines put me on a flight back to Brussels. Therefore, I have never used my partial tickets Istanbul-Dakar and Dakar-Istanbul and they have committed on their website to refund these tickets. However, they are now making it a nightmare to claim back. Throughout the situation, no communication was provided to travellers, staff assistance was poor (the first food provided arrived after more than 10h), and even now the support provided is just not acceptable. There was never an apologies or concerned expressed. You do not want to be stuck in Turkey in the middle of a military coup and have to depend on them.",Detractor
"My partner and I were on flight TK53 from Tokyo to Istanbul and were due to get a connecting flight home to Dublin (TK1975). Approximately 2 hours before we landed, we saw live TV coverage of the Coup from Istanbul and waited for updates from cabin crew. An hour later, the pilot announced that we would not be landing in Istanbul due to ""operational reasons"". This was the one and only announcement given until 12 hours later. We landed in Antalya and were brought into a working terminal. We sat and waited patiently. At 6am, we were bussed to another terminal - an unused, abandoned terminal with no facilities or options to get food and very little air con on what was an extremely warm morning. There were no reps from Turkish Airlines, there was no WIFI, there was no communication of any sort. At midday, a cafe was opened and food served at high prices. The free food of water and bread became tiresome as that was our only option since landing at 4am. At 8pm we were informed our flight would be returning to Istanbul and there we would be met by reps who would transfer our boarding passes. We were assured all would run smoothly and we would have the option of getting a hotel for the night. Upon arrival at Istanbul, we joined the queue for the transfer desk. It took 6.5 hours to reach the top of the queue - no reps, nobody to answer questions, no customer service whatsoever. When we finally got to the desk, we were met by staff members who were more interested in updating their Facebook Status' rather than helping the customers standing in front of them. There was no sense of concern or apology.",Detractor
"  Flew New York JFK to Brussels via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines was great, definitely recommend. The food was very good for economy class - I ordered vegetarian meals, which are almost always bland and generally awful, but I had no complaints. They seemed rather sophisticated and quite tasty for airline food, and you actually eat with real, metal utensils. The seats were comfortable enough (probably the most average portion of the flight), and my transatlantic flight had TVs (as expected for a 10-11 hr flight) with good selection, and my shorter flight (4 hrs) had overhead TVs that were available for everyone to watch. Best part of Turkish, though, is that they really do take care of you. On my transatlantic voyage, they provided a package with slippers/blanket/sleep mask/headphones/toothbrush and more. The bathrooms had real flowers in them, and they came around many times with food and drink - first with Turkish Delight, then with a different cake, then with dinner, then coffee/tea, then breakfast, then coffee/tea a second time). Overall, great experience. Clean, comfortable planes, really good prices, quite good food, and it seems a genuine care for passengers.",Promoter
"  I flew with Turkish Airlines from London Heathrow to Seoul via Istanbul on the 28th of June. During check in for the bag drop, I found that my seat reservation had been changed, unknowingly, which was a disappointment considering I had reserved my seats with the company via telephone. Upon taking my seat and checking out the IFE I found that the Map screen wasn't working at all, which was another disappointment, I'd seen one person call the flight attendant asking her the same thing. The entertainment, meaning the music and movie selection was good but not great. Nothing that was particularly new. We were given Turkish Delight as soon as all the passengers were settled down - it was A nice unique touch to their service. The flight attendants were dressed smartly and were attentive, however, looked moody and tired. The food service was brilliant. I chose the pasta option and it was very good. The side dishes accompanying it were very good also. Their Homemade Lemonade with Mint was really refreshing. The flight was proceeding ahead as normal until we landed and were at the gate ready to disembark the aircraft. We were told to take our seat's because the airport authorities wouldn't let us off. We were not aware of the issues at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport. The crew didn't mention it to us but people slowly started to find out. We were held on the plane for 6 hours, without any food - water was available but the crew had run out of cups which made it difficult for people to stay hydrated. After disembarking the plane via stairs, we were rushed off into Terminal Buses to take us to the airport entrance, once it was safe. By this time it was 2am and I had missed my connecting flight. It was canceled due to the incident - all flights were. The amount of stranded passengers in the terminal was overwhelming, and to see that no Turkish Airlines staff were there to assist us with the queries we all had was shocking. In incidents like these, when these things happen staff should be there to assist with the backlog of passengers. I ended up waiting until 9am for the information desk to open to re-book my flight to Seoul. When I finally got on the flight to Seoul, the service was immaculate. Everything worked and the flight was great. We were given Turkish Delight and Hot Towels, including complimentary amenity kits and a menu which clearly stated what the meal options were. Snacks anytime you wanted and the flight attendants regularly came with drinks to keep everyone quenched. The flight attendants were attentive and friendly and it was generally a pleasurable flight. The only thing I'd say having been on two flights was that I felt we were being treated like royalty on the longer long haul flights and less attended to on the shorter ones i.e London to Istanbul - we didn't get hot towels or much attention. Overall their in-flight service is very good, food is top notch, however, their ground staff could do with more training in customer management.",Passive
"  I flew with Turkish Airlines from Kuala Lumpur to Munster (via Istanbul) and returned from Berlin to Kuala Lumpur (via Istanbul). All flights departed and arrived on time. The aircraft was clean and fresh, as well as the cabin crew. The seat was comfortable and the temperature inside the aircraft was set to a perfect one for me. The food was also very nice and delicious. However, the food tray did not sit properly on the table. The bottom side of the tray was not flat (it might be deformed due to the heat from previous meals) so it moved every time I used a knife or spoon on the food. It happened on all the four flights. The cabin crew and ground staff were very kind and polite. The inflight Entertainment was excellent, but the touchscreen (on some aircraft) was not as responsive as I expected. Overall, enjoyable flights and I will fly with them in future.",Promoter

The aircraft was newish with individual IFE screens at every seat. The legroom was poor even for someone who is 5'7"".

"Our first trip with Turkish Airlines. We had chosen this carrier, because it had the best flight schedule for flights out of Stuttgart to Mauritius. Flights STR-IST/ IST-STR on A321, IST-MRU / MRU-IST on A330. Planes new and in very good condition. All flights were (more or less) on time. Transfer in Istanbul on outbound flight was easy and quick. Unfortunately online check-in for return flight from MRU to IST was not possible and we had to collect our boarding pass for the leg IST to STR at Transfer Desk in IST and therefore had to queue for a while. On all flights very good service. Great variety of drinks. Full meal even on the legs STR-IST / IST-STR. On longhaul legs 2 full meals with choices and sandwich service throughout entire flight. Amenity kit offered on both longhaul legs. Great IFE system with a large selection of movies, TV shows, music and Live TV. Legroom in Economy is not very good. Felt a little cramped. For larger persons it can get uncomfortable, Luckily flights were not full, so we were able to spread out and find some sleep. Friendly crew members. Overall a good experience. Too bad, TK doesn't offer Premium Economy on these flights, they even decided to abolish Premium Eco even on 777 flights.",Promoter
"The flights from and to Istanbul in Business are usually very high comfort and the lounge in Istanbul is one of the best worldwide. However, flights to and from most destinations in Africa in the Boeing 737 are not worth their money.

"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Milano Malpensa (IT) to San Francisco via Istanbul, with my wife and two kids. On the first leg (Milano to Istanbul), we received a full meal and my kids dedicated gifts (toys and book). On the main leg from Istanbul to San Francisco, we received complimentary trousses (yes, in the economy class) two full meals + free availability of sandwiches and beverages, my kids received other dedicated gifts and trousses. Meals were generally good, even the pasta was good. The Flight Entertainment System maybe needs some adjustments: the games keep freezing, so I had to ask to the staff (really friendly and responsive) to restart at least three time the display of one on my sons. We did the online check-in, so we had a dedicated counter fro baggage drop-off at check-in, avoiding the queues of the economy class. Unfortunately, in seat map shown during online check-in the presence of the baby bassinettes was not indicated, so I discovered it only during the flight, not so comfortable. Moreover, the website is not so user friendly, it is impossible to select a special meal for example. Conclusion: Airline, staff and services really OK.

Onboard the service was pretty good with decent food especially since the flights were relatively short. Business class with the A320 is your luck of the draw, on one of the 3 flights in this aircraft type business class was simply an economy seat with the middle seat left empty as is the case with European airlines. This is unfair to passengers who are paying a lot of money only to end up in an economy seat, on the A330 it is a completely different experience with a massive seat, tons of privacy and space an altogether different experience.

The best I have tasted in a long time and we are frequent travelers. The planes were all very full.

Our plane arrived shortly after 7pm and after customs and trying to find a Turkish Airlines rep to fill out the missing luggage form, we didn't leave the airport until 3.5 hours later, We had a 3.5 hour drive home from Houston so we were completely exhausted when we got home. They said we can expect to receive our luggage within 3-4 business days because they will need to put it on a United Airlines flight to San Antonio to get it us. While they are not confrontational, they just pretend that you do not exist after you make a request to be upgraded.

"Singapore to Brussels via Istanbul, returning from Berlin. To Brussels, everything ran like clockwork and a satisfactory experience. Food and entertainment were on par with other carriers. But when things go wrong, TK falls apart. A technical fault delayed my flight back from Berlin. Initially, the delay was announced to be 90 minutes, meaning many passengers would miss connections in IST, including myself. The fate of transit passengers was left to the transfer desk in IST, as TXL ground staff refused to do anything. This was extremely nerve-racking because my connecting flight to SIN operated only daily, so I would have had to stay overnight in IST if I missed it. When I explained the situation and asked to be re-booked from TXL, ground staff rejected my request, and said they could do nothing nor provide any information on my connecting flight. Several transit passengers were frustrated over the lack of answers resulting in arguments with ground staff. There were further delays during boarding, and no explanations or revised departure time was provided. Eventually, the flight left 2.5 hours late. In IST, transfer desk said SIN flight was over 4 hours late. Why couldn't the ground staff in TXL tell me this?

"  London Gatwick to Mombasa with Turkish Airlines. TK currently have rock-bottom fares (around Â£1300 return to MBA from LGW). Arrival / departure times are inconvenient which may be a contributing factor. TK use the new Number 1 lounge at LGW. The â€˜onboard chef' on TK flights is a lot of fuss about nothing. The â€˜chef' on the first short sector to IST is simply a flight attendant in a chef's hat who serves the drinks and most of the food. There was no chef on the long-haul sector. The food offering was excellent on both flights. There is a Turkish flair to the menu (Mezze, Turkish coffee, Turkish wines), however there is enough to choose from to please the less adventurous palate. The seat is clearly the reason that the lower fares are currently offered on the route. The seats are not flatbed. They are similar to most airline's Premium Economy seat offer. Good leg-room, a foot rest and good recline. Other than that a normal medium haul business class seat. If I was paying the fare BA or KQ charge on the route I would have something to grumble about, but I am not â€“ so did not. Everyone talks about the lounge at IST. It certainly is large, and impressive with self-service bars throughout, deli-style counters with sweets, cakes and savoury options. The pizza chefs, BBQ chefs, pasta chefs cook for the streams of passengers queuing for them. There is a virtual golf range, scalextric track to â€˜play' with in addition to cinemas, pool tables and a huge library. There are massage therapists with whom you can book an in-seat massage too - but order this early as waiting times can be long. The thing is, the lounge is so big you tend to sit in one spot where you find a seat (there are no â€˜quiet areas', just lots of seats and tables dotted around). It's big and brash (like the network and advertising for it), and I will go back â€“ but it's not â€˜special'. The staff were also not especially welcoming. Questions about availability of yoghurt for example was met with a disinterested, â€œI don't know â€“ look over thereâ€. There was no feeling of being a special guest. It felt more like we were being done a favour by being allowed into the lounge â€“ now we must fend for ourselves. Even if you are not travelling in business class, IST is a fab transit point. Excellent shops, restaurants and bars. Both my wife and I said it will be our preferred transit stop, whichever class we travel in future. Signage could be improved and the information points were staffed were not interested in offering any form of â€˜customer service'. The one time we asked for directions we were answered with grunts and a tired â€˜nod' in the direction we should go. I would hesitate letting anyone transit alone who was unsure about how to get around an airport (elderly parent etc.), simply because of the lack of genuine help available by the staff on duty. The service of the flight to Kenya was equally good with nice choices from the menu. The presentation could do with some work â€“ meals brought out from the galley wrapped in foil (from an airline boasting top cuisine and a chef?) which is unceremoniously unwrapped in front of you. Turkish coffee was made from instant powder in full view of the cabin before being served (nicely) with Turkish delight. This was a little disappointing. Overall, a good product at an excellent price. The food service is good and transit process reasonably easy for frequent travellers. We will definitely book this airline again on this route.",Promoter
"  Manila to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. I am on the flight as I write this review there is one hour to go of a 12 hour flight. Today May 8, 2016, left on the 7th. I would have to rate Turkish Airlines in the top three if not the top. The seat was the best as far as layout comfort storage, TV screen nice big size and plenty to choose from easy to use. Internet on the flight. The chef on board was friendly and accommodating took care of a couple of requests with a smile. Had a good comfortable sleep for 6-7 hours Price for business was one of the cheaper ones. Overall enjoyed the experience, on Turkish Airlines and would choose them again.",Promoter
"  Antalya to Frankfurt via Istanbul. Out of 4 airplanes flown, 3 were rather dirty and had limited or no entertainment systems. No WiFi was available onboard. After arrival in Istanbul, it took 10 minutes for the stairs to arrive and another 10 minutes for the shuttle buses to come. Istanbul domestic is similar to La Guardia. Miles&Smiles I contacted TK more than 10 times and spend USD 60 on phone costs without getting any professional reply - at both Istanbul Miles&Smiles desks the staff was busy doing their personal things and any customer was an unwelcomed intrusion. The girl at the outside Miles&Smiles desk made it clear that she will not answer any questions and is only hired to print cards. The guy at the int'l inside Miles&Smiles desk refused to answer my question and I had to pay USD 30 entry fee to a nearby lounge to get my answer. Don't call them. Just write a message and maybe you will receive a reply within 2-8 biz days. If you have anything urgent, too bad. If you have a question at check-in, go directly to the supervisor. There, you might have a chance to get an answer - I asked the supervisor at the Istanbul lounge about the lousy Miles&Smiles service. She refused to answer, refused to investigate, and refused to forward anything. She told me to write an email to customer care - Turkish Airlines staff guided me to the wrong security check-in, because of that, I was stuck with customs / police for over an hour. There is no Turkish Airlines customer care service at Istanbul domestic airport or outside of security at the international terminal. I contacted customer care and didn't receive any answer to any of above raised points. Turkish Airlines have a few points that they advertise and that are great (like the Istanbul lounge), with most other things, I felt like Turkish Airlines is only a large cheap budget airline. I am still waiting for a reply from Turkish Airlines.",Detractor

"  I booked my Turkish Airlines flight from San Francisco to Vienna via Istanbul, and was nervous by the mixed feedback. But after 4 different flights (4 different planes, 4 different crews, all international) I can say I was fairly pleased with Turkish Airlines. Seats were more or less ok, each head rest had it's own USB so that's a plus - food was average, and I thought the staff was fairly friendly. Their English was ""eh"" but if you're leaving the states anyway it's really a moot point by then. I believe most of their flights are routed through IST, which I found an easy airport to navigate. I'd feel comfortable with a short layover here (like an hour) if that's a concern for anyone.",Promoter

"San Francisco to Istanbul and return in the past 3 weeks with Turkish Airlines. These were the two single best flights in my many years of long distance travel. The newest business class seats (the plane was 3 weeks old) now have plenty of storage space under the foot rest. The service was friendly and very helpful (repeatedly checking in on our needs, smiling, energetic). The food was top quality (as good as a decent restaurant). Lie flat seats that are quite comfortable. This product far exceeds what you get on United, Lufthansa, and Air France to Europe out of SFO and tends to sell at about 40% less money than these other carriers. My only complaints is that drink service tends to be a bit neglected (e.g., if you want a second glass of wine you are going to have to ask for it, no one will offer). That's not much of a problem.",Promoter
"  Yesterday I returned to London Heathrow from Istanbul on flight TK1971, I have flown Turkish Airlines before and found them to be very good, however yesterday cabin service was poor. It was almost 2 hours into the flight before we were served a drink and the meal choice was just one pasta option, we were told that the meat options had gone. My wife cannot eat pasta so was given a vegetarian dish which looked very unappetising and my pasta was lukewarm and dry.

"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul Ataturk to Cairo on a midnight flight. Check in was easy and quick, departure lounge was chaotic. A member of Turkish Airlines ground staff was very rude to passengers who had questions about their flight and shouted at one passenger who then refused to fly. Other passengers were telling the ground staff member to calm down and behave appropriately. Passengers were very uncomfortable about the situation. Although the ground staff work for TGS, this incident reflects part of the overall Turkish Airlines product unfortunately. Most passengers had up to three pieces of carry on baggage which delayed the departure of the flight as carry on luggage would not all fit in the over head bins on the aircraft. Turkish Airlines would become more efficient if it enforced a strict carry on baggage policy like other leading airlines do. Onboard experience was OK. Food on the flight was quickly served. It was a cardboard box containing a sandwich, salad and a mousse which was not as good as Egyptair hot food offering on the same route and not what one expects for the amount of money paid for the flight.",Passive

For a couple of years I have flown quite a lot with this airline and I have been very satisfied with the service and performance, however recently it seems like the previous high standard is declining. The flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul was okay, but the journey from Istanbul to Dar Es Salaam was nothing to write home about - not something good at least. Mediocre meal, uninterested crew, fixed seat without any possibility for adjustments etc. I hope that Turkish Airlines will show it previous strength and performance on the way back. I will still recommend THY on this background.",Detractor

"  I flew a total of 4 Turkish Airlines flights on my recent trip to Europe, from New York to Paris CDG via Istanbul, returning from Frankfurt to New York via Istanbul. The cabin crew were warm and friendly, food was quite good for aircraft food, especially if you are a fan of Turkish food. Expect a small salad, a yogurt/tsatziki sauce, choice between a chicken dish and a beef dish, with the lighter meal consisting of a pasta dish. There's warm bread and I've eaten more hummus on those four flights than I have in my life. The new A330s have a great entertainment system, with a nice multi-touch display, live TV, and wi-fi (purchase necessary). The slightly older A330 going from IST to CDG also had an older touchscreen display but was a bit unresponsive to input. The actual movies and TV shows were the same regardless of the hardware and so it was easy to overlook the hardware troubles. There is decent legroom although you start to feel a little claustrophobic once the person in front of you reclines back. For longer flights, they provide a little pouch of amenities like an eye mask, ear plugs, slippers, lip balm, and a toothbrush/toothpaste. For the price I've paid, I found the flights to be a genuinely pleasant experience and I would definitely fly with them again.",Promoter

On time departure and scheduled arrival to LHR. Both the ground and onboard experience are superior to anything on offer by other European carriers. Refined catering with several meal choices, even though the business cabin was nearly full, all meal choices were available. The ""Bat"" shaped menu, referencing their recent sponsorship was a nice touch. Both internet access (free of charge for J Pax) and live TV available throughout flight. Even managed to get a brief nap before our landing to Heathrow thanks to the comfort of the lie-flat seats. All in all a 5-Star experience considering this being a intra-Europe flight.

"  Bangkok to New York via Istanbul. I have nostalgic affection for Turkish, and have flown them many times from Istanbul to New York - their Premium Economy on that route is one of the great bargains of air travel. Their Business product is another matter, though it has its good points. I flew it long haul from Bangkok to New York with mixed results. The A330 is small and cramped, especially if you are used to flying the A380 with Emirates, say. Cathay also fly this plane, however, and they herringbone the seats to give you privacy. No such luck with Turkish. The 2-2-2 configuration means you are either next to someone snoring with no divider - and no privacy whatsoever - or you are constantly leaping over someones legs to get to the bathroom. The cabin felt claustrophobic and hot for this reason. Food is superb and yes I love the little candles! Service is also professional and smiling and wines are high quality. Inflight entertainment is pretty mediocre : small screens, not much choice and low-brow movie selection. As is quite common with Turkish, my connection with New York was missed and when I arrived in Istanbul there was zero help from ground staff. I was just left to fend for myself. Appointments for the following day in NY duly cancelled, I struggled for four hours to get out of the airport with my (temporarily misplaced) bags and get a hotel voucher (vast line, an offer for a three star hotel). Not a Business class experience, to say the least. The limitations of Istanbul airport are not the fault of Turkish, of course, but the airline needs to seriously rethink its ground operations in the event of transit mishaps, especially as they are so common that I now hesitate about doing any connections in Istanbul. I arrived in NY the next day in a pretty bad mood. Coming back, boarding at JFK was like a rugby scrum, with no priority boarding and no organization. Stress all the way. All in all, Turkish Airlines try hard to make the on-bard experience friendly and gastronomically coddling which one has to appreciate, But for several thousands dollars I think I'll be flying a Far Eastern or Gulf airline next time - the product is just so much better and more logistically sophisticated. As many others have noted here, there is no customer service and so your little complaint will go entirely ignored, as mine was. In the future, I will use Turkish for short haul flights in Economy because they fly to alot of places and are good value for money. I'll leave Business trips to the big boys.",Detractor
"  Flew Turkish Airlines from Cape Town to Istanbul via Durban. Boarding: No boarding music, no pre-departure champagne offered (must be requested), no nuts/snacks offered with drinks (must be requested). Cabin/seat: dull grey cabin with no special lighting effects/mood lighting/flowers etc, rather dated business class seat in 2-2-2 layout, broken tray table storage mechanism meant my table protruded into seat area for 14 hours - especially uncomfortable when attempting to sleep. Technician attempted but failed to repair it during the stopover in Durban. Service: service from Cape Town was minimalist, but following a replacement crew in Durban things improved slightly. Nevertheless timing was too often off - starters and main courses were served but no accompanying wine offered (requested), it took over three hours to serve and clear a relatively small business cabin before lights were turned off, then switched on (not even gradually) 2.5 hours before landing for a quick breakfast service accomplished in an hour which left passengers bleary eyed and waiting for landing. A rather persistent cabin crew member insisted I and the passenger next to me raise our seat backs to almost 90 degrees forty minutes before landing (most decent airlines show some discretion is this regard until nearing final approach). Entertainment: limited selection of movies and TV shows, no WiFi/connectivity. Due to system issues it was reset at least twice en-route, unavailable for ten minutes each time, and meant having to fast-forward through films to the point at which it had been turned off. Arrival: parked at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal on arrival in Istanbul, found the spacious and well appointed Turkish Airlines lounge but waiting time for a shower was two hours. Opted to queue for a toilet. All-in all a rather disappointing and unrefined experience, relieved not to have paid for this trip myself, and wouldn't recommend Turkish Business Class when other (in particular Gulf) airlines offer a far better long-haul product.",Detractor
"Short legs from Rome to Istanbul and return were perfect, with real business class seats. Istanbul Ataturk Airport is presently a disaster, even for business class. It's overcrowded and business lounge difficult to find. The A340 to CPT obviously had been an ""outgoing model"". We boarded 2 hours late from the maintenance hangar - but arrived only one hour late in CPT. The worst were the seats. Although they nearly fully recline, the foot-rests do not hold up, which makes sleeping economy-class like. The fatigued upholstery was improved by sleeping-bag like covers provided by the crew. The worst had to come on the return leg from Cape-Town: the entertainment system on my seat had no sound and could not be fixed. Service and food had been good business class standard. With B/C-tickets about 700.- to 1000.- Euro cheaper than most competition, one probably has to tolerate imperfections.",Passive

"  I have taken Turkish Airlines flights from Mumbai to Dublin via Istanbul return flight multiple times - last one was March 2016. Boarding in Mumbai was fine on time. Food (Indian vegeterian) was good, cabin crew were helpful and asked us if we need baby food. Transit in Istanbul is the only worst part (so far) of this airline. Plane doesn't park at aerobridge and you need to take shuttle bus from plane to airport. Walk from airport entry gate to lounge is long. No pram for family travelers. You need to go through a security check before reaching transit area or lounge. Walk from airport gate to lounge is long without enough travelevators and you need to cut across crowd in congested area. Turkish Airlines Lounge in Istanbul is excellent - plenty of variety of foods and drink. A nice children play area and changing room. Flight from Istanbul to Dublin was almost empty. Cabin crew suggested us to leave bassinet seat and go to back of the plane and occupy a 3 seater. It was good suggestion, our baby slept peacefully there. Return from Dublin was an issue, at airport all display boards showed flight will depart from gate 307 (?), when we reached there 10 min before gate closure, we didn't see a single staff or notice there. We thought gate closed and everyone left, but wondering how come they closed and left 10 min before schedule closing time. Got panicked. display boards still showing gate #307. In this situation I thought to check with nearby gate staff but it was unmanned - the other adjacent gate was behind a wall. Went there, and boarding was happening at gate 308.

"  Oslo to Dhaka via Istanbul return. I have travelled with Turkish Airlines some times the past year, and it seems there is always is some sort of mishap - delays, technical problems with the entertainment system, booking of seats that doesn't exist etc. However, my past trip with made me wonder if they have heard of the term ""customer service"". I had booked their website. The trip passed through Istanbul with one hour waiting time. At 2am the day before my trip (ie. 34 hours before departure) I received an email (and email only) that my flight to Istanbul was 5 hours delayed, but there were no information about my flight from Istanbul, so I called customer service. It turned out that my flight had been cancelled, and that I had been shifted on a later flight, but Turkish hadn't thought about what effects that had on my flight from Istanbul. The initial thought of the customer service was that I had to stay overnight at Istanbul, and then take the flight the next day. There is only 1 flight from Istanbul to my destination every day, so that meant that I were facing a 24 hours delay and that I would have to wait until 6pm before my flight departed. When I told the customer service that this was not doable, he said that there were seats available on the flight to Istanbul on an earlier flight ( departure 7.30a, instead of noon), but that there were only business class seats left and that I had to upgrade my ticket. That is of course not acceptable. After 32 minutes on the phone with customer service, I got booked on to that earlier flight (giving me an 5 hours additional wait in Istanbul, but at least not a 24 hour delay to my arrival time). When I boarded that flight, I was seated in one of the economy seats that were supposed to be unavailable, and it also turned out that there were plenty of free seats on economy class. What kind of customer service is this? Unfortunately I had another horrible experience with Turkish on my flight back, where I were denied to check-in because I met up at the airport 52 minutes before departure instead of the required 60 minutes. There were no problems in assisting the business class passenger who arrived at the same time as me, but I was rejected because of these 8 minutes. I have never been late on check-in before, but I have seen many exemples of airline companies bending over backwards to help their passengers (especially if it was the last flight for the day, or in this case the only). Turkish would rather exploit it's customers. The irony is that this very trip was the one that earned me the last points for a membership upgrade. I will go to great lengths to avoid this airline in the future.",Detractor
"  I currently work in Adjara, Georgia and the nearest airport is at Batumi. As I am a UK citizen, I frequently fly between Manchester, UK and Batumi, Georgia via Istanbul Ataturk. I have made bookings for three trips between Batumi and Istanbul over the last three months and I have to say the performance of the airline on this route is shockingly poor. On 29 December 2015, my flight from Istanbul to Batumi was cancelled. Weather conditions at Batumi were blamed. I was offered an alternative flight to Trabzon, Turkey instead being told there would be a bus transfer to Batumi. On arrival at Trabzon, there was no information about a bus transfer and no-one seemed to have clue about what to do. Eventually, I managed to find someone who put me on a bus (it was obvious this had not been arranged to cater for the disruption) which then left meet at the Georgian border at Sarpi. I was then forced to make my own travel arrangements from there. On 24 February 2016 my flight from Batumi to Istanbul was cancelled. Once again weather conditions were blamed. Today (24 March) my flight from Batumi to Istanbul has again been cancelled with weather conditions at Istanbul Ataturk airport being blamed. However, on checking the Turkish Airlines website, it was noted that other international flights are recorded as having landed at this airport at around the same time my own was due to land. My work colleagues have also experienced similar disruptions and cancellations to their flights over the last three months (some of their experiences were even worse!). The flight between Istanbul and Batumi is supposed to be a scheduled daily flight. However, the level of disruption leads many of us working here in Georgia to believe the airline does not value its customers and can just cancel flights when it wishes if it believes it does not have enough passengers - with weather conditions being blamed as a way to avoid having to pay compensation. As far as I am concerned, this airline does not deserve the award of best airline in Europe.",Detractor
  Malta to Kilimanjaro via Dar es Salaam. We are frequent flyers with Turkish Airlines and our experience in this case was bad enough that we will probably never fly with them again. 7 hour flights at 2am and 4am in aircraft so small and old that the seat inclined (when it worked) just 30 degrees. Crew mostly indifferent. Food also indifferent - normally the food and service plus sky chefs on Turkish warrant a 5 star review on their own. We asked at Istanbul lounge if we could speak to a member of customer service about our experience and they said 'No. Post via the website'. So we did. Nobody even acknowledged. We love the Istanbul lounge and the food there and (normally) the food on board. But in general indifferent has got into the habit of seeing customers as pesky unwanted extras that get in the way of their job. So maybe they're just telling us to go to another airline.

"Flight from Dubai was delayed by an hour. Reached Istanbul expecting to have missed my flight as I arrived 30 mins before the flight. As soon as I arrived and finished Transfer Security Check, on checking the screen for the flights, Catania was missing from the Screen. Customer care they told me I have to change the Ticket at the transfer desk. On reaching the Transfer Desk I found there were quite a few travellers to Catania facing this issue. After the long queue, the guy at the counter had no idea what was going on and did not even care when I asked him what happened. One person at the counter said the flight had been cancelled so they are making a new flight early morning next day. Another Staff said the flight took off. Staff treated us as if we were cattle and without any hesitation decided which flight we ought to take. Finally after deciding I would go at the 6:45 am flight the next day, they arranged for the hotel stay and ask me to contact the hotel desk outside passport control. On asking about Visa, they say that I need to pay an extra 43USD. I found it pathetic that inspite of robbing us the time and our money for a service we paid to reach a destination at a certain time, they had the audacity to ask the passengers to pay extra. The Staff was actually like ""We are giving Hotel and Free Shuttle so you can at least pay this"". Really disappointed with the attitude of the Staff.",Detractor
"Our family of 4, flew with Turkish airlines from London to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul return. London to Istanbul the aircraft was excellent, equipped with the latest entertainment - essential for keeping the kids occupied! The staff on board were so friendly and welcoming. From Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur, I couldn't help feeling as if we had been 'downgraded' as the front row in which we were sitting, only 1 out of 4 screens worked! One was stuck and 3 didn't work, so as there was ample space behind, my husband and son moved backwards, which was ok but meant we were sitting separately for most of the flight. The staff were less friendly than the first. These two factors made me feel a little disheartened. On our return journey, from Kuala Lumpur to London via Istanbul, we had an excellent journey. The entertainment was excellent, food was delicious, toilets were maintained and kept clean to a high standard and the staff were superb. However on the last leg of the journey, from Istanbul to London, we were very disappointed with the aircraft itself. It felt as if we were on a low cost carrier, as there was literally no entertainment onboard as there seemed to be a technical glitch on all the screens. That was a huge disappointment, as we expected to have a good quality plane, having paid a premium price for the journey. But the staff were exceptional and did their best to cater for us, ensuring the children were comfortable. Overall, we enjoyed flying on Turkish Airlines. They seem to take pride in the cleanliness of their aircraft, which says a lot about an airline. The food was to a high standard and the kids were gifted various toys as souvenirs of their journey.

The staff sometimes are very friendly, but I also experienced them as unfriendly. The problem is that on my 4 flights I had 3 times a late check in, and 2 times a late arrival. One time I arrived 3 hours late with no apology fom the pilot at all.",Passive
"New York JFK airport to Mauritius via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines, and overall good service. Entertainment can be improved in terms of choice. Mechanism to provide free hotel during long transit should be improved as no guidance is given to passengers. Though promised a hotel we did not get it. The staff in charge of hotel desk was rude. Level of English of airline staff at Istanbul airport needs improvement. Airport infrastructure, layout, lack of signage to direct passengers and service are deficient and impact negatively on the airline. Main piece of luggage was delayed for 2 days.",Passive
"Birmingham to Bangkok via Istanbul. Onboard the best food I've had in the air and the service onboard is fantastic. Turkish Airlines ground staff however are terrible on all counts. In Istanbul they offer priority boarding for business class, priority boarding for a bus that is. A bus that you then stand on for half an hour before getting crammed with all other passengers before taking you on the long journey to the plane and a scrum on the stairs. The lounge in Istanbul is great but seems to be operating at absolute maximum capacity. It really is a tale of an airline that gets some things so right, and others so very wrong.",Passive
Houston to Karachi via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines - after I had booked I started having second thoughts.

"Prague to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Checked-in online for my flight with the app - boarded the aircraft - first impressions, very outdated decor - like from 1980's but clean and comfortable.

Crew were very friendly, made nice conversation and in-flight service was nice, meal was surprisingly good. Would recommend this airline for short-haul flights.",Passive
"Istanbul to Cairo. Check in and lounge at Ataturk Airport is very good. Boarding though never seems to be straightforward at this airport. Waited about 15 minutes in a crowded bus waiting to go out to the aircraft. Ground crew are unfriendly and unhelpful. The catering seems to have been downgraded on flights to Egypt from Turkey to cold meals that resemble Turkish Airlines domestic meals. Thankfully I ate in the lounge before the flight. For the price of the ticket, the catering needs to return to what was offered previously. Flight attendants non-existent for most of the journey.",Passive

There is no CIP lounge at Almaty for Turkish Airlines passengers, just a very small communal departure area. Catering was OK, although not a very large meal for breakfast. Inflight entertainment was fine. Cabin service OK - crew seemed to disappear after serving meal. Had free seats next to me so was perfect to spread out.",Promoter
"Edinburgh to Dalaman via Istanbul Business Class - a paid upgrade to Business Class. Nice lounge Edinburgh Airport. Proper Business Class seats on a 737-800, very comfortable. Handed a menu which they swiftly took away, they didn't have enough Business Class meals loaded so I got an Economy meal. One bathroom at front of Business but occupied so I used the rear one in Economy, only noticed there was no toilet roll. 4 Crew sat in rear talking. An 8 Hour layover in Istanbul, no lounge or accommodation provided. Dalaman to Edinburgh via Istanbul in Economy. Do not sit in Row 10 of Airbus they use A320? Elderly gentleman could not get his legs in, sat sideways, rude crew when he asked for help. Boeing 737-800 to Edinburgh comfortable in row 11. Handed a menu. At meal time no choice, they ran out from row 5 to 11. Meal, tea and coffee.. service over. Great seat back tvs. Case at Airport had been damaged and torn.

"Turkish Airlines had the most competitive rate for the route I traveled. I travel to play golf and they will carry your clubs at no extra fee, unlike other airlines which will charge hundreds of dollars/euros more. Advance registration was simple and effective. Flight attendants are friendly and helpful. They do not speak a whole lot of english but enough to get you to and from your travel points. The food was very good. Alcohol is included but they do not give it out very generously. The entertainment system is first rate and includes more than enough variety to satisfy any traveler. I travel to Europe a couple times each year and they have the cheapest rate from my departure city into any city in Europe. I am very satisfied with this airline.",Promoter
"Turkish Airlines prices are competitive and seats are good. Arriving on Zurich airport I went to pick up my boarding passes, since a digital version appears not to be one of the options. They could only hand over the first leg to Istanbul as they had computer problems. ""Doesn't matter, you are flying Business"" was their response. Arriving in Istanbul I visited the transfer desk. Rarely does one see people who put so little effort into their job, truly amazing. On other business class flights I made had staff try make you feel comfortable and welcome but not on Turkish. The worst thing is that chances are you'll pass through Istanbul airport. Absence of priority boarding, many busses and an airport probably the perfect size for 25% of the travellers it actually welcomes on a daily basis.",Detractor

"Bangkok to Gatwick via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Used the EVA Air lounge in Bangkok which is of a very high standard, good choice of food and drinks. The flight was good, full flat bed, plenty of room, good food and chef on board, staff a bit slow bringing bread and drinks. Used the very busy lounge at Istanbul, poor selection of food at breakfast, quite good at other times when I have used it. I was angry that customer relations are so bad with Turkish Airlines - I had a 16hour layover and should have been put up in a hotel. They could not get me on earlier flights as they were full, but they would not get hotel for me so I booked my own at my own expense and had to purchase electronic visas for my son and myself. The flight from Istanbul to London was okay, just daytime seats and mine did not recline. Overall for the price paid, the flights were good value. I would travel with them again in spite of the hotel problem.",Promoter

Return flight from Dusseldorf same style of airplane looked a little older flight, from Istanbul to Tel Aviv a very old airplane. No more or less comfortable then any other short flight I have experienced. Food was good I will give them that. Boarding procedure could be better, and if as myself you have a gold card from Star Alliance, you would expect a preferential service even if my gold status was not issued to me by Turkish. Boarding priority was totaly not the case. The Turkish Airlines lounge in Istanbul airport is the best I have ever used, but lounge in Tel Aviv and Dusseldorf airport were bad. Istanbul airport is poorly organised.",Passive
"We flew Turkish Airlines from Manchester to Istanbul then onto Bangkok (return). All flights on time and check-in procedures quick and efficient. Onboard the service was very good and seats comfortable. IFE was a bit limited, but enough to keep us amused. Staff were very pleasant, smiling, courteous and polite. Beds made up by the crew on request. Drinks service was good, and food, though not 'on-demand', was absolutely delicious. A good choice of wines to accompany the courses. I enjoyed the meals I chose and had no problem obtaining my first choices on any of the flights. Lounge at Manchester was pretty poor, but IST was excellent and BKK was very good.",Promoter
"Check in at Gatwick was quick and was advised that flight to Istanbul was on time. By the time I had got through security,the departure board was showing a 35 minute delay. Was able to use the Clubroom Business Lounge in South Terminal and it was fine though very crowded. It did however provide a fine ,clear view of the single runway at Gatwick so after about 30 minutes there, was able to see the aircraft queuing for take off turn around and make their way back to the departure gates. This was followed by a display of a wide variety of emergency vehicles who proceeded to spray the runway in an attempt to clean up a fuel or oil spill. For about an hour nothing moved though no announcements were made in the lounge. Eventually, we boarded the flight and just sat there for about 45 minutes. The Captain kept us advised as take off was put back yet another 10 minutes though there was at no time any apology for the delay. Eventually took off well over two hours late and as I had 80 minutes to make my onward connection in Istanbul had the flight been on time, I realised I might have problems. Spoke to the purser during the flight who explained that Istanbul had experienced fog that morning. She added that as so many passengers on board were connecting to Bangkok, the onward flight would be held for us. Rather stupidly, I believed her. Flight was uneventful and service, seat comfort fine but after we landed at Istanbul, we taxied for about 20 minutes and were then bussed into the terminal. Despite the delay, no Turkish Airlines staff met the arriving passengers and the airport was chaotic. Eventually, I found an airline staff member who said my connnection was missed and telling me to go to the transfer desk. I found this and was concerned to see long queues. After about an hour I manged to attract the attention of a Turkish Airlines official and asked whether premium class passengers were expected to be treated like this whereupon he told me I had been directed to the wrong transfer desk. I found the business class transfer area and after a short wait was told I had been transferred onto a flight leaving at 0045, 6 hours after my planned departure time. By the time I got to the Turkish Airlines lounge my new flight was also showing a delay of an hour though the staff at the desk warned me it could be longer. The Lounge was so crowded. My onward flight to Bangkok was delayed by just an hour and again there was no apology or explanation. The flight was fine with a standard business lie flat seat. What was especially good was the standard of catering and the fact the the meal was served so quickly. It is a pity that what is essentially a good product at a very attractive price is so let down by such chaos when things start to go wrong.",Detractor
"Excellent experience on our flights from London Gatwick to Johannesburg via Istanbul return. Turkish Airlines staff were friendly from check in through to the gate and on board, we could not fault. The service on board with complementary Turkish Delight, hot towels, menus and well stocked amenity kits was excellent, as was the quality of food - which really was high for an airline.

"Istanbul to Sao Paulo with Turkish Airlines. I arrived at AtatÃ¼rk Airport at 6:00am of Feb. 4th. (so more than 3 hours before the departure time). The lady who attended me at the check-in counter first gave me the boarding tickets putting me and my family in sequential seats in the same row (51). But before she gave me the boarding tickets, she decided to talk to another attendant and after that she decided to reprint the tickets putting us in totally different seats. Note: one of the passengers was my daughter and she is just 1.5 years old! I tried several times to explain to the check-in lady that I was flying with my daughter and at least the father or the mother must travel together with her â€“ I bought a seat for her just to provide better accommodation and to not bother the other passengers. But she became angry and arrogant, just told me that I would have to solve this â€œproblemâ€ by myself with the gate staff or even with the flight attendants, or even ask people in the airplane to change the seats with me. So in summary the problem was created by Turkish Airlines and I would have to solve it by myself. At that time, I started to be angry with the arrogance and incompetence of the check-in staff, starting with the point that is simply unacceptable to have people working for Turkish Airlines in the International check-in desk who are not fluent in English â€“ without mentioning that they simply ignored the fact that a 1.5 years-old baby would fly alone with the insane arrangement this lady provided me at the check-in desk. Well, still following the instructions gave to me by the check-in lady, two other ladies who were working at the gate simply ignored my requirements. Only after I had to yell to one of that women, she told me (with a very angry face that she could not help me and I would have to solve this problem by myself inside the plane. When the gate was released for embarking, another employee required and took over my tickets and asked me and my family to wait outside the finger. We waited about 20 minutes and when almost all passengers entered into the plane, another employee gave me the tickets back and said that I would have to solve the problem by myself. At that time, I was fed up with the arrogance of employees who forced me to wait 20 minutes for nothing, and once I entered into the plane I had to start to yell in order to be attended by the chief of flight attendants, who had the courage to propose my wife to hold my daughter in the same seat, giving away to another passenger the extra seat that we bought. Only after I suggested to call the airport Police and required the presence of the airplane captain (and at that time my wife and my daughter were already crying) the crew moved and miraculously three seats appears at row 47!",Detractor

"Do not fly from Cape Town with Turkish Airlines. Business class did not have flat beds as they admit that the oldest A340-300 planes are used on this route. This resulted in the most uncomfortable night. The exclusive to business class toilet was out of order and the other toilets are very small. The entertainment is pathetic. There is no book containing the entertainment options available. The movies are extremely limited compared to other airlines and the main blockbuster has long ago left even the south African circuit. When I wanted to change my flight to the Cape Town - Johannesburg route so as not to be subjected to this plane again it cost me more than 6 thousand rands and I still have to pay for the trip from Johannesburg to Cape Town.

I arrived at the Turkish Airlines check in counter in Istanbul 2.5 hours prior to my scheduled departure and was told the flight was overbooked so I would be placed on standby, but should get on the flight. I didn't and from there the nightmare began. I was sent to 4-5 different counters and told different instructions at each one. No one at Turkish Airlines seemed interested in getting me on another flight. I understand overbooking flights is a common practice by most airlines, but there appeared to be no standard process in place to deal with passengers who have been bumped. The staff were extremely rude, unhelpful and offered no apology for my 7 hour delay. There was promise of compensation, but I haven't seen any compensation yet.

"While in Nepal we were informed of a 2 hr delay of our Turkish Airlines return flight upon arrival in IST. There was no info about the connecting flight to Stuttgart for which there would be only 1/2 h to get it. Back in KTM we learned that we'd have to stay the night in IST. We managed to get a flight a day earlier, thus at least making up for the time loss. The flight was very pleasant. But info and service on arrival that evening in IST was appalling. We had to find our own way through the airport, no signs and not knowing where to report for the hotel supplied by the airline. After standing in line for the passport controll we were told we need a visa, so we had to go back to another counter and pay 50 USD for a visa. When, finally finding the counter for the hotel, there was another long lineup and and afterwards we sat waiting for a shuttle. The hotel was 10 min away, very nice and we got a late supper around 22:30. The food was disappointing. Next morning, without breakfast, we had to shuttle back to the airport at 5 in the morning for a 9:30 flight. We were through security and passport controlls by 5:30, the gate wasn't announced until 8:20 and only then we were able to go and sit. All these are things that happen when travelling. But what annoys me to no end is that the airline refuses to refund our visa fee. What makes it worse is the reason given: we supposedly acknowledged the delay when we altered out flight, flying a day earlier. I suppose we did acknowledge the delay -2 hrs is nothing - but we certainly did not acknowledge additional expenses. The downtown airline office in STG does not deal with customer complaints and is not helpful in any way. The same applies to the airport office. My request then forwarded to IST was first returned because it was in German. For every message to IST one has to jump all the hoops on their website and over and over again fill out the forms. The very poor info-policy and service of Turkish Airlines, the only way to deal with the airline through IST and not in one's own country and the refusal to refund our visa fee totally spoils an otherwise pleasant experience with the airline.",Detractor

"Turkish Airlines flight from Ankara to Istanbul with 6 hours delay on 21 January 2016. Boarding time was 10.25 and departure (scheduled) 10.55. Boarding completed and the gate was closed around 10.45. Normally this route is only 50 minutes. There was severe snow in Ankara. The aircraft has waited nearly two hours before take-off. Two hours later gave the news the flight had been cancelled. The passengers were requested to wait in the aircraft till it boards the gate. However 40 minutes after the announcement of cancellation, we heard another announcement that the aircraft perform its flight, however certain passengers declared that they do not want to fly, so the aircraft will wait till they leave and then perform the flight - the cancellation decision has been cancelled. Certain passengers left the aircraft voluntarily. Those who opted to fly waited till their luggage be removed. The following surprise was, the aircraft accepted new passengers once certain passengers left and their luggages removed. The newcomers luggage loaded in Cargo. Then another announcement ""Those passengers Who do not want to fly may get off"". A second wave of passengers left the aircraft and their luggages removed. The total delay has been 6 hours. Two consecutive flights on the same ESB-IST route after our TK2127 have been performed with 60-90 minutes delay. Snow is not sufficient to explain the reason of such delay. The cabin crew was really helpful and they served water, food, beverages with a pleasure. However Turkish Airlines failed the crisis management. The cabin crew performed the security demonstration three times because the aircraft was incoming new passengers as some other passengers preferred not to fly and leave. I had an intercontinental flight with KLM departing from Istanbul and I could tolerate 6 hours delay maximum, unfortunately I lost my intercontinental flight. A delay over 6 hours was out of my imagination. If the flight had been cancelled, I would not submit any complain and acccept the situation. I firmly believe that this extraordinary delay happened because the new passengers have been accepted to the aircraft, rather than the security concerns.",Detractor

Only little niggle was that I was unable to connect to wifi on the Istanbul - KL leg of the journey - just wouldn't work even though they tell you it's available. I can't fault them.",Promoter
"A new A330 from Bangkok to Istanbul and onboard Wifi and Live TV functions were available. Free for Business Class passengers. I have been flying TK for over 20 years and this was one of the most energetic, sincere and smiling crew I have come across. Even the Purser made a genuine effort to please passengers, which is not very common. Catering was good. The only letdown was that I wasn't able to use the kiosk for check-in at BKK which meant that I had to wait almost 2 hours for ground agents to arrive to the counter. The Turkish Airlines Airport office at BKK was not staffed as usual. The EVA Air lounge at Bangkok is much better than Thai Airways Royal Orchid.",Promoter
"As a regular customer of Turkish Airlines I now have to write a review of the horrible experience we had flying back from Addis Abeba om Jan 2nd (plus the delay of our luggage on the way there on Dec 20th). It started on arrival in Addis on Dec 20th, none of our 5 bags had made it, it turned out that due to a change of plane there was not enough space in the hold and they had left most of them behind in Istanbul. Had to go back to the aiport the next day to get the bags, fortunately they were all there. Then on the way back our flight to Istanbul had a delay of more than 3 hours. We all boarded but then had to sit on the tarmac for 1.5 hours because they had to unload half of the luggage and told us it would arrive later. Of course we missed the connection in Istanbul and were greeted with total chaos due to the fact that extremely light snow had fallen. We had to queue for 4 hours together with hundreds of other people, no water, no food, many very angry people and no help whatsoever from any Turkish Airlines staff. To make a long story short: only because I insisted on getting on a flight that day were we lucky enough to be put on a flight to Amsterdam (not Brussels) which departed in total chaos as well. Many people were stranded for more than one night. We arrived in Amsterdam with 14 hours delay and no luggage. This was delivered to us after 5 days. Service on board this time was a lot less as well, IFE was not working or was not there at all, food was not as tasty and it was a very old plane on the leg to and from Addis. Next time I fly to Addis I will use another airline.",Detractor
"25 hours prior to departure I am informed by Turkish Airlines email that my flight (Muscat to Manchester via Istanbul) is cancelled, and next flight is 24 hours later. Too late for the funeral I was attending. 3 hours later being put on hold and told that nothing can be done and please go to the airport (only 3 hours drive away) decided to give up and book Emirates instead. Hope I get a refund (paid weeks ago through credit card). Being an Elite Card member served no advantage in the discussions either. They have a good business class lounge for members but that is where it ends. So disappointing as have been loyal over the years.",Detractor
"Denver to Kathmandu via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Great food, but once you land in Istanbul, they don't give any damn about service. You will see staff on their personal phone surrounded by frustrated customers trying to find answer. I literally had to yell to catch attention. No empathy but lot of attitude. Also, I found few staff with no English at all.",Detractor
"Ankara to Boston via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Flight had nice service on flight, but at the crews convenience. First flight from Ankara to Istanbul was late which resulted in running to my international flight on the other side of Istanbul airport. That flight also took off late which put my arrival in Boston late. Once in Boston we sat on the runway for an hour waiting for a parking place. Completely unacceptable. You get what you pay for, so if you want a cheap flight that is not on time, this is the one to fly. Will not fly again.",Detractor
"Boarded my Turkish Airlines flight from Madrid to New Delhi via Istanbul on 21st January. My flight was late from Madrid so I caught my connecting flight runningly. When I landed in New Delhi I got to know that my baggage is stuck at Istanbul.They assured me that my baggage will be delivered to my doorstep within 24 hours. Today it's my third day of a week long trip only and they still hasn't delivered my luggage. The third vendor who they are using to deliver delayed baggages is rude and said that we will deliver it and we can't tell you when. No one is picking the phone and by chance if you are lucky and they pick up, they simply tell you ""we will update you"" which they never do.",Detractor
"Istanbul to Amsterdam with Turkish Airlines, and terrible service on the ground and in the air. Apparently the plane got changed, so people got assigned new seats by hand at the gate. My friend got reallocated from 5 to 27, last row in the plane, because a local guy didn't like sitting in the back. When he complained, he was talked to very rudely. The lady handling our queue all of a sudden decided to do something else, and leave us waiting. Boarding itself was according to row, but didn't get enforced, so when we entered, 90% of the plane was already full, including almost all overhead space. We had a huge delay, with close to zero explanation. When people asked about connections, they were told ""not my problem"", the temperature onboard was at 28 degrees, first we were told they can't change it, then later when half the plane complained, all of a sudden they could. I can accept delays, and even getting other seats. But the lack of courtesy, and plain rude behaviour of staff is not excusable. Last time I fly Turkish Airlines.",Detractor
"What a disappointment! We boarded the Turkish Airlines flight Kilimanjaro via Mombasa to Istanbul. This plane came from Istanbul - and was not cleaned during the stopover in Kilimanjaro. I found my seat dirty, used blankets and pillows - where I would be sitting for the next 9 hours during the night. Staff was tired and not friendly. The first stop would be Mombasa where the rest of the passengeres from Istanbul deboarded and others joined our flight back to Istanbul. On this 45 minute flights not even water was served and their were only 50 people on board. Take into account that at Kilimanjaro airport the shops where already closed during the night. At Mombasa the flight crew changed and cleaning staff came on board to ""clean"" the plane while we had to wait on board. They just folded away the used blankets - so the new passengers could use it. Everything on time, we departed from Mombasa at 3am. At 4am they turned on the light, served us a hot meal! Who wants to eat something at that time. Approx. 70% of people just wanted to sleep and did it. 5 hours later before landing at Istanbul, where most people woke up and were hungry, they just served a sandwich. Strange service concept. Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk airport is a mess to transfer. So crowded, bad announcements and dirty. I don't want to mentioned the toilets there. Flight to Hamburg was ok, staff was a little bit friendlier and meal good. Their English skills really basic. The A321-200 was in bad condition. Dirty, some bins taped to hold them closed, my IFE screen broken, sound not working. In all I'm disappointed by this service experience. Only positive: the flights were on time and we landed safely.",Detractor
"I haven't actually flown Turkish Airlines as I haven't been able to get so far as flying. I booked a flight via a travel web site to fly with Turkish Airlines in May 2016. Three days after receiving confirmation from the travel web site I checked the Turkish Airlines web site to see if I could choose my seats. The airline booking number given to me showed my reservations were cancelled. I checked my credit card and saw a charge of $824 for one ticket on my account and a pending charge of $3000 for the other 3 tickets purchased. I called the travel web site immediately since I know I am supposed to deal with them first. The rep for the travel web site contacted Turkish Airlines and kept me on hold for over an hour while he spoke with reservation agents and supervisors. Nobody could tell us exactly what happened or why. The agents simply stated the reservation was cancelled by the airline for some unknown reason. However, the reservation agents stated I would still be charged the full price for all four tickets as the tickets were non-refundable. Talk about unethical business practice. The airline screws up, cancels my booking without my consent or knowledge, and then charges me almost $4000. I understand charging the full price on a non-refundable ticket if the purchaser chooses to cancel, but how can the airline make that decision without any reason? The Turkish Airlines agent said nothing could be done on his end to rectify or correct the situation and that the travel web site agent would have to call a corporate sales office to work something out if it was possible. Mind you, nobody is saying I will get the situation taken care of. They are only saying I may be able to get the situation taken care of if I talk to the right people. I called Turkish Airlines myself the next day and was told the same thing: IF the situation can be fixed I would only be able to do so with the permission of the higher ups. When I asked for contact information for the corporate offices I was told to, ""look it up on the Internet and find it on my own."" Awesome customer service - just kidding. I did look up and call all of the corporate sales offices listed. None of them even put me through to a person. One had me on hold after the automated menu for 15 minutes and cut me off. Another simply had an auto message that stated, ""We cannot take your call. Goodbye."" And the others just rang. Realizing I may not resolve the issue before the pending charge of $3000 went through and a lot of time/red tape I promptly contacted my credit card company and explained the situation. The credit card company contacted Turkish Airlines and were given the same IFs and MAYs, so the credit card company went ahead and refunded me the $824 and promised to block the $3000 or refund it immediately if it went through before they could stop it. In other words book with caution as the customer service is awful and their practices can be very unethical.",Detractor
"Montreal to Ho Chi Minh City via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Value for your money, excellent quality of service. Flight attendants helpful, food was excellent, the seats were great and I did not experience a delay. No wifi on board. Inflight entertainment program is diverse. The only reason why I have stopped flying with Turkish airlines is because on the LH Miles&More program, to which they are affiliated, you only get 25 % of the miles you've actually flown, whatever your seating class is (I flew in business class and only got 2 % of the miles). The other setback is the fact that Istanbul Ataturk airport is one of their main hubs and this airport is just horrible - too small, totally unadapted to what ought to be a travelers experience today. So if you fly with Turkish Airlines, you're very likely to have to transit through this airport.",Promoter
Venice to Istanbul on a new A321 with the personal screens. Flight landed at Ataturk 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Cabin crew nice and efficient. Istanbul to Jakarta on an A330-200 with the old seats type which I personally do not like. Flight left 35 minutes late due to airport congestion but landed in Indonesia half an hour early. Both flights not full. I have noticed that food portions in Economy class have increased on long-haul flights. Food quality is top notch. I am an Elite Star Alliance Gold member and fly Turkish Airlines often and have never experienced any big delays or had luggage lost or damaged. The Business lounge at Ataturk airport is impressive.,Promoter
"Malaga to Istanbul on TK1306 on 22 January 2016. Having recently acquired Elite status on Turkish Airlines, I was well aware that they are great in the air but pretty ordinary on the ground. Based on this flight with my wife today, I am ready to change that opinion. TK has become pretty ordinary both in the air and on the ground. I was confident that we would get exit row seats at check in at Malaga but were told all seats were taken. Luckily, I prevailed on the agent to give us a window and aisle with the middle seat vacant, which she did. There is no in-flight recognition by Turkish Airlines of a person's Elite status. My wife's seat did not recline. The crew were downright poorly trained. They did not do a seat belt inspection before take off and landing, window blinds remained closed as well. Food service was surly. The rice was cold, got standard kebabs that were awful. When I asked for a second helping of water, I was met with a glare. The crew spoke very poor English - something very common with Turkish Airlines cabin crews. When we landed in Istanbul after being in a holding pattern for 45 minutes, we were at the far remote end of the airport. The first bus left and we were left standing in freezing weather waiting for the next bus. Then the chaos of IST airport. All in all, a pretty dismal experience.

"My flight Turkish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Munich via Istanbul was cancelled and I was not notified. I found out once I got to the airport. I went through a brief security before going to check my bag in. The women who checked my bag than got extremely upset, borderline yelling at me, saying that I didn't go through the security area. It got to the point where the man who put me through security had to come and calm her down. Incompetent in the fact that the new flight they put me on had a 7 hour layover in Istanbul. The check in person, promised my bag would go to Munich, which of course it didn't - when I finally arrived in Munich and talked to the representative about my missing baggage, she said that since I was flying back to Minneapolis the next day instead of sending my bag to Munich they would just send it to Minneapolis, than have it delivered to my house, which was a lie. When I tried to track my luggage once I was home it didn't work. I called their customer service, who to be extremely kind, are inadequate at all and any part of their job, to try to locate my bag. The gentleman stated my bag arrived in Minneapolis on Sunday, it was lost on a Friday, and that it should be shipped to my house tomorrow. The next day comes and still no bag so I call back. The man tells me that my bag just passed customs and they have 24 hours to deliver it to me. I wait two days before calling back, quite annoyed at this point. The man I talked to this time tells me my bag went to Munich and that's all he can see. So I let him know that other customer service staff I talked to were able to find out much more and he should get better at his job. He was than able to see my bag came to the US through Icelandair and is in MSP airport. I told him that everyone I've talked to has said it will be shipped to my house and when I would be able to expect it. He said they don't work with any delivery company in the US and that he isn't able to give me any more information. So when I asked him what I was supposed to do about getting my bag back and he responded with â€œI don't knowâ€, I don't think he was ready for the reaction he got. After showing him my frustration he was then able to locate the airline that my bag got to Minneapolis with and gave me their phone number. I called the airline and sure enough my bag had been sitting in their office all week. So after being lied to, by multiple people, that my bag would be shipped to my house, I had to make a 4 hour drive to the airport to pick it up over a week after it was lost. So don't fly this airline unless you want to be so upset that you write a short novel on how much you despise them.",Detractor
"Los Angeles to Tel Aviv via Istanbul and I've never flown Turkish Airlines, and after reading reviews I was nervous. At check in, I knew that one of my bags weighed more than the 50lb allowance, but the woman at the ticket counter was sweet enough to let it slide, and didn't charge me the extra fee. I flew with a friend who bought his ticket before mine, so we didn't have seats next to each other. The women at the gate were sweet enough to tell us there was a row in the back of the plane with nobody occupying it, so him and I were able to spread out amongst 3 seats and actually be comfortable. As soon as we took off they handed out coffee and drinks, little candies and a warm towel. My one issue is that by the time they got to our row, they had run out of the veggie option for dinner. I don't eat non-kosher meat so I ended up not eating, but that was my own fault for not requesting a special meal. The flight went by quickly, and the staff was very sweet and helpful. Even on the second flight, which was only an hour and a half long, we got served a dinner and drinks. The on-board chef even brought this little girl a cake out to the cabin because it was her birthday. I've never seen an airline do that, and it put a smile on my face seeing them go well out of their way to do something that sweet. Will absolutely fly them again!",Promoter
"We had four flights with Turkish Airlines in December 2015 and January 2016, and every one was a complete disaster. From the entertainment systems not working, rude and unhelpful staff to the delays and lost baggage. I have been trying to find where our bags are for three weeks and nobody can help. When we were delayed for over 8 hours they did not even provide water. Every queue we stood in the result was the same. Please go to counter 'XY' where they will help. It cost me an arm and a leg to get home and then they lost my luggage leaving my without clothes or toiletries. If you email them you will be met with a standard email template reply. To put the cherry on the top of our trip, when returning to Gatwick they left everyone's luggage in the carts and expected passengers to unload bags. Needless to say bags were being thrown around and dropped. See the picture.",Detractor
"I just returned from a trip where I used Turkish Airlines, flying from San Francisco to Rome via Istanbul. I left San Francisco on January 1st. Check in went fine. The flight was fine. I had a layover in Istanbul and then on to Rome. I got to Rome and had no luggage. I was told it was left in Istanbul. The form was filled out and I was told they would deliver it to me either the next day or the day after that. This made me nervous as we were leaving for a cruise 4 days after my arrival in Rome. I didn't hear anything the first day. I tried to call them all through the second day and it was constantly busy, so I emailed them. They responded and said they did not have my luggage. I emailed every day and got the same reply every day for four days until we left on the cruise. Everything I needed for that cruise was in that bag - all the formal gowns, shoes, purses, etc. Once onboard the ship, they also tried to contact Turkish Airlines, but were not given any type of response. I called the airline during the cruise. I was told my claim had been closed and that my luggage had been delivered. When I questioned them about this as I had not received my luggage, they stopped responding to me. I called again and they told me to call a different number which I did. In the end, I was told to call four different numbers before they told me to call back to the original number. Each time I was told they could not help me. When I returned to Rome 16 days later, I went to the airport to try and find my luggage. After a considerable amount of time, they found it. A bit too late, however. Not having my luggage meant my daughter and I could not attend the three formal gala nights on the ship - the thing we were most looking forward to. Although we tried not to let the situation ruin the cruise, it definitely was not the vacation we had hoped for. For my return flight, Turkish Airlines cancelled the first flight and rebooked me on a flight four hours later. They caused me to miss my connecting flight. They were not concerned about my second leg, although it was booked on their airline. When I pushed them to get me home, they ended up booking me on British Airways. When I asked about compensation for the 1500 euros I had to spend on clothes, toiletries, etc, I was told sorry, fill out a form and someone will probably get back to you. So, here I am, not getting compensation and no one will respond to my emails or talk to me in person. Save yourself a ton of heartache and use a different airline. If anyone from Turkish airlines is bothering to read this and actually wants to help, I would welcome an email from you.",Detractor
"Me and wife flew Turkish Airlines from Toronto to Lahore with a layover in Istanbul. The plane from Toronto to Istanbul was a little cramped for legroom, which was a 3x4x3 setting. I can't sit for very long and had to get up a few times and there was very little leg room to stretch my legs, my knees were almost touching the seat in front of me and I am not the tallest guy under 6'. Entertainment system was nice though, nice big screen with a lot of variety, the earbuds the airline provided are terrible for fitting, so just use yours with the adapter they provide. Touch screen is a little annoying as they don't have the best accuracy. One of the few airlines that provide care package that includes slippers, socks, ear plugs, toothbrush and paste, wich is really nice. If you have little kids they will come around prior to take off with little baggies for them. Plane was clean overall, and the crew were overall very nice although English is not the best, making it hard to understand at times. Food was hit and miss. The main meal was decent, the dessert was great. Our next flight after this was from Istanbul to Lahore and the seating was roomier thats for sure. I think I would have enjoyed the flight more if not for the 4 hour layover that was compounded with a 4 hour delay with another 2 hour delay on the tarmac. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were nice once again. The food was again hit and miss as this time the main meal was not so great, dessert was nice though. Also whats nice is that you can ask for a sandwhich or dessert anytime during the flight or get up and go the the kitchen area and they have water or juice ready for you. Coming back, again the planes were clean and cabin crew were nice. Entertainment system was working all the way through. No delays at the airport this time. Overall I would say this is a decent airline, not the best. They have one big flaw and that is they are known for delays. I was told even before I flew that be prepared for this, I took this remark with a grain of salt as I know that it happens with all airlines. When we got to Istanbul I have never seen so many delays and cancellation on the gate screen, so be prepared for that.",Passive

"Some snow in Istanbul the day before my flight completely overwhelmed Istanbul airport and Turkish Airlines. My flight was 4 hours late out of Berlin. The bus in IST took another 15 minutes to leave the plane and my connecting flight to Johannesburg was nowhere signposted, and no ground staff around that could be asked. Maybe that was just bad luck, but than the nightmare (3 am) began. There was a queue of hundreds of people in front of a transfer desk which did not move at all! There seemed to be quite some ground staff behind the counter, but it was not clear what they did except walking back and forth ignoring passengers' pleads. Children were sleeping on the floor next to the line. After three hours I left my travel companion in the line and walked the airport to find another less crowded travel desk. Here ground staff was also walking away from exhausted passengers and their questions. Ground staff sent passengers to the other transfer desk to get rid of them. I persisted and finally got a boarding pass for a day later. No offer of food, accommodation or anything (7 am). The flight the following day was again 3 hours late and did not make up for the disaster. Filthy seat, uninterested crew and poor food. I don't support reviewers opinion on food. The only smiles I got on the roundtrip was in TXL and JNB at check-in from non TK staff. Return trip was uneventful but I witnessed IST ground staff again walking away from customers who missed a connecting flight to Athens due to a late arrival.

"Vienna to New York JFK via Istanbul, and the flight from Vienna to Istanbul was pleasant and generally unremarkable until landing in Istanbul. It was pouring rain, the aircraft was parked and buses arrived to take us to the main airport. A bus for business class was provided, however when we tried to board, a ground person aggressive waved his arms and yelled, ""No more"". I said, ""we are business class,"" and tried to show my boarding pass only to have him become more aggressive, and shout, ""go"". There are no signs in the gate areas to direct traveler with connections to the the business class lounges. The flight from Istanbul to New York JFK was dismal. I will say the only saving grace is the food service is very good. The overhead bins are literally 1/3 filled with bedding and other equipment. The crew seemed trained to ignore service than provide service. Baggage service at JFK was very slow, and of course when our bags finally arrived, they were completely soaked, obviously having been left out uncovered in Istanbul!",Detractor

When we came to Iran the nightmare began. Our suitcases didn't arrive we had to go to the funeral the next day but we didn't have our stuff for three days.

Call center staff does not know the benefits each frequent flyer tier of their own program offers. Ground staff overall not helpful. However when it comes to the actual flight, things can change, their service up in the air is really good. Both my flights at this trip I received a real good service.

"I had more than 20 flights on Turkish in the last 15 months, both international (European) and domestic. Out of those flights, half of them were on time with the other half were delayed by about an hour - only one had a four hour delay because of weather. As long as everything goes right, TK is a pretty good airline, but as soon as something goes wrong, their disaster management is a disaster itself and as a passenger you're usually left with no information about what's going on. Besides that, ground services are pretty slow as well and sometimes you're waiting for more than half an hour at the luggage belt. Seats on the narrowbody fleet are mostly okay while those on the A330s are pretty uncomfortable (didn't try the B777 so far). Turkish Airlines inflight catering is excellent and oustanding compared to most other airlines. When changing planes either at AtatÃ¼rk or Sabiha GÃ¶kcen airport, allow yourself some extra connecting time as flights are often a bit delayed and baggage handling and immigration (for domestic connections) sometimes takes ages. That extra time also increases the chance your luggage will make it on the connecting flight too. To sum it up, I reccommend Turkish but you should also be aware of the possible drawbacks.",Passive

I decided to try to get my luggage and given false information - it was on my connecting flight, then it's here somewhere but we cant possibly get it for you. I was then directed outside of the airport by a police officer and had to go back through security to get back in. I joined the 6 hour queue at Turkish Airlines desk and managed to get another flight 2 days later. I then had to join the Supervisor queue then the hotel queue and finally put up at a hotel. When I returned to my allocated flight I was told twice that my luggage was on the flight, guess what I arrived Gatwick and No luggage! And no compensation for things I had to pay for.",Detractor

"Like others have said here, the service by Turkish Airlines over New Year 2016 was appalling. I was flying Baghdad to London via Istanbul, and eventually arrived in London 31 hours late. The delays are bad enough and are far worse than can be justified by the bad weather alone - don't they know it snows sometimes! But it was the service and couldn't be bothered that made it so much worse. The level of service at the transfer desk for people who had missed connecting flights was so bad I thought it must be a hidden camera TV show. There were about 500 people in the queue, but only 4 or 5 people working. There was no security and on several occasions fights nearly broke out. This is not surprising as it was the early hours of the morning and people were tired. Any decent airline would have put on extra staff and kept people updated. They would have identified elderly passengers and people with young children and provided them with special service. I was in neither of these categories but would have understood the need. What I would not have understood was why it seemed Turkish passengers able to speak the language were frequently being given special treatment and allowed to jump the line. I was stood in this queue for 4 hours and not once did I see anyone that vaguely looked in charge. It was atrocious. But no one from Turkish Airlines seemed very bothered. Whilst TK might be cheap, you clearly get what you pay for! A lesson learned for me. TK claims to be one of the best airlines in Europe. Under EU law I would be entitled to some compensation I'm sure (even the bad weather can't justify such a terrible delays) but I doubt Turkish Airlines will live up to those standards. Because they so unreliable I'm sure it suits them not to have to.",Detractor
"When things go wrong (which often they do when it comes to international air travel) Turkish Airlines simply are not equipped to handle it, nor do they have any interest.

Turkish Airlines uses confusion, bouncing their customers from call center to call center and desk to desk, playing them in circles until they tire and give up. Most of their flights connect through Istanbul airport and it is pure chaos. A shiny building and western style stores and restaurants do not make up for under experienced, under trained and the lack of an idea of what the concept of customer service is. This is something I experienced on a flight from Chicago to Istanbul 7 days ago. In the 7 day time span my bag has been ""found"" 3 times, even informing me of its location at the Sofia airport. I had confirmation from a Turkish Airlines desk, and their Call center. When I traveled there to gather it, I was told it was never there. The lost luggage airport staff in Sofia informed me this happened with 80% of the people coming to the airport to gather luggage sent by Turkish Airlines. I have never seen anything like this. Yes, the flights are cheap and they pamper you inflight, but be aware you are gambling.",Detractor
"Houston to Abuja via Istanbul. I chose Turkish Airlines because they were the cheapest when I bought the tickets. When I arrived to Abuja I found that a only a portion of luggage came from the flight. Many of us on the plane had to wait over 5 days just for the luggage to arrive and they never contacted us by phone or email. What's worse was that several flights that came to Abuja as well, and had the same thing happen as well.",Detractor
"The flight arrived late for my connecting flight in Istanbul to Aqaba, Jordan - the next available flight was in 3 days. They then told me to check google for other flights (yeah that's right, they told me to check Google). After four hours I managed to negotiate a flight the next day. They then told me my luggage was lost after 3 hours of waiting. They then took 4 hours to take me to a hotel, were late to pick me up the next morning to get on the next flight. And here the drama really started. Turkish Airlines booked me on a Royal Jordanian flight - but obviously hadn't told them. So I went to Royal Jordanian, they said I had no flight and that I should go to Turkish Airlines. TK told me to go back to RJ, and RJ told me to go back to TK. Eventually, TK did their job and spoke to RJ who put me on their flight. But, only as far as Amman. Which meant I would have to pay for a hotel and another flight to Aqaba - utterly ridiculous. And to make matters worse, they couldn't find my luggage. So to cut a long story short, I made my way from Amman to Aqaba, and three days later, I still have no luggage. Turkish Airlines are a joke. In short, they spend too much time tweeting how good they are, and paying for adverts to do their job.",Detractor
"London Heathrow to Tokyo Narita via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Firstly we were delayed for 1.5hrs, it happens sometimes, I get it. But when you have to transfer and the airline know they will not transfer your luggage but fail to mention is another story. They had 1 hr in transit to do this but instead made everyone who originated from London wait for an hour at the baggage belt before being instructed to fill a lost baggage form. I had only 2 nights in my destination and spent a lot of the time trying to speak to someone and when I finally got through I instructed the lady on the phone when the lost baggage comes in I will pick it up as I am coming back to the airport before I head to the mountain, she said this was fine and she made a note. On the day I arrived to the airport I got an email saying it will be sent to my hotel by the mountain and will arrive 2 days later. I then had to head to minus temperatures with no jacket and will have to buy / rent all my snow gear. Thanks Turkish airlines for making my trip stressful and needlessly more expensive. Apparently over 150 lost baggage came in that day so this seems to be a common occurrence. Avoid airline if you don't want to be wearing the same clothes for 3 days!",Detractor
"On January 1st, 2016, my flight from Tehran to Istanbul (TK875) was delayed for over 5 hours. The passengers, including myself did not receive any prior notification from the airline. Considering that many previous flights were cancelled due to weather conditions in Istanbul, the airline had surely predicted delay, but failed to inform the passengers, or make announcements in the airport. No information was provided from the Turkish Airline Staff, and finally when the plane took off and landed in Istanbul, we had to wait another 2 hours for the plane to be allowed to park. I had already missed my flight to New York (TK 003) which was scheduled for 7:25 on that morning. I understand that sometimes the weather conditions can cause delays and cancellations. What I am complaining about is the poor management, rude attitude of Turkish Airline Staff, and the very low-quality service provided by the staff in the airport. When I finally got out of the plane, we were confronted with a terminal full of stranded, confused, and unorganized passengers. There was no airport or Turkish Airlines Staff to guide us to the correct directions. Naturally we went to the Transfer Desk, to get information on how to get on the next available flight. More than 1500 passengers were jammed around the counter. There was not even one airport, security or airline staff to organize people and ask them to stand in line. Every one was just jammed in front of the counter. There was rarely enough space to breathe or move. The staff behind the transfer desk were clearly incapable of managing the situation. Instead of managing it, they also lost control and were shouting and banging their fists on the counter! After 2 hours of standing there, my passport was lost by one of the staff, and I had to wait for another hour for them to find it. Only to find out that all that trouble was for nothing, as I was told to go through passport control and then to the Check-in terminal, and go to Turkish Sales Office. This demonstrates the incapability and poor management of the airline and staff. They wanted to get rid of me by making me enter Turkey (through passport control) and go to check-in terminal, so that I am not their problem any more! I had no other choice, so I followed their advice. The Sales Office line was a nightmare. The line stretched all along the Ataturk Airport check-in Terminal. Turkish Airlines Staff couldn't care less. They acted indifferent and did not help in any way. I immediately begged one of the staff to help me get on the last flight of the day (TK11) at 5:30. A staff member helped me go through and I was told that I can sit on flight TK11 to New York, on business class, and they told me to go to Business Check-in Counter E.",Detractor
"I had traveled with Turkish Airline 3 times now. The last time from Dhaka to Toronto via Istanbul was the worst experience I have had. Their flight from Bangladesh was delayed which reduced the transit time in Istanbul considerably. The staff at Istanbul can barely communicate in English. I was helping a neighbor friend with two children as there were none to help them even with proper direction. And they closed the gate without us although we had our boarding pass. They didn't search for us or even care to find us. Afterwards they flew the family without any further charge but not me, I had to pay for a full ticket. I tried to reason with them but alas if only they could not communicate in English.",Detractor
"On my sisters return from Cape Town, the Istanbul to London leg was cancelled. Istanbul airport was a shambles. Few people could or cared to speak English and airline staff were rude, dismissive and aggressive. They were in a queue for 4 hours to be told they need to return the following day. My nephew had a broken foot and was in a cast. They were also told to sleep in the airport as there was no available accommodation. They arrived home 48 hours after leaving CT. Their 3 suitcases have subsequently been lost. After 10 days they've received no feedback, no returned calls and their calls ring unanswered. When my sister did get through she was told there was no update. We understand that life happens. Bad weather and many other factors mean flights are cancelled but the rudeness experienced as an English speaking woman with an injured son by this establishment is deplorable.",Detractor
"Appalling customer service! Due to snowfall in Istanbul, my flight from Taipei to Istanbul was delayed by 7 hours and I missed my connecting flight to London. The staff at Taipei had reissued my ticket for a later flight but this was cancelled at the last minute without any information. I was treated rudely by staff at the airport (both ground staff and Turkish Airlines reps) forced to queue up in 5 different queues for many hours and buy a Â£20 entry visa to Turkey to pass into a different section of the airport in order to get the airline to reissue my ticket. When they reissued it they told us that we had to rush as boarding time was in 30 minutes, so I prioritised getting to the gate over staying at the reissue desk to deal with the baggage information. We then discovered that the new flight was 10.5 hours late and they hadn't told us. Turkish Airlines caused more chaos at the boarding gate as they let people onto the plane who had only been issued with standby tickets and then had too many people trying to board the plane. After a 23 hour delay I reached London, only to be told by the Turkish Airlines lost baggage rep that despite being sure my baggage was not on the flight (given what happened in Istanbul and the fact that it was not found on the LHR system) I had to wait two hours by the belt while the staff shifted bags on and off it while everyone on my connecting flight stood around unable to see their bags. Finally I was allowed to fill out a lost baggage form. After three days I called to see if there was any progress and discovered they had mixed up the details of the bag's description. After 9 days by bag was finally returned to me.",Detractor

"London to Singapore via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines, and a 22 hour delay on the ground. Outbound to London, everything went excellent - service by attendants and minimal delays taking off and landing. When I fell asleep on the first leg from Singapore to Istanbul and couldn't find my glasses, the attendant was very helpful in searching for it, even ripping out the seat in case it was stuck there. Food was really good also, considering when I slept through meal service and by the time I woke up, the flight attendant told me that my meal wasn't fresh anymore so she gave me a business class vegetarian meal instead. However, on my inbound flight on New Year's Eve/day, everything was a mess! I showed up at Heathrow to hear of a flight delay. Supposedly 1 hour became four, then five hours due to snow. They could have updated the website or sent a courtesy email so I didn't have to spend 8 hours at the airport before take off. Landed in Istanbul after circling for 2 hours due to lack of landing spots and another 2 hours waiting on the runway. Missed my connecting flight of course, and had to queue for 2 hours to get rebooked and re-sorted out on my next flight back to Singapore. Total chaos there with 30 crying babies at any one time and very rude, sneaky men cutting in line and making offensive remarks when I didn't let them cut in behind/infront of me. Ground staff and customer service desperately need training on conflict resolution and soft skills. Finally got on my plane, yet after another 1:30 delay. In flight entertainment wasn't working and the attendant had to spend an hour trying to fix my console as the flight was completely full. At least the meal service was wonderfully tasty.",Passive
"Hoi Chi Minh City to Istanbul via Bangkok, and this was the first time i flown Turkish Airlines. I've heard a a lot about it, but it didn't meet my expectations. The legroom is smaller than some Asian airlines, and it's was hard to stay comfortable for a long-haul flight. Flight crew were not as friendly like I thought. They have a wide selection of movies and games to try, the food and beverages were outstanding, even though it was just economy class meal. So overall, I recommended this airline but they should improve their seat comfort for long-haul flight.",Passive

Ample amount of snacks at the galley for passengers to eat at anytime during the flight. Service was commendable.",Promoter
"Extremely unhappy and will never use Turkish Airlines again. An 8 hr delay in Cairo caused to miss our connecting flight, and we had to wait for 26 hrs in Istanbul Airport. For our return, a 2 hrs delay in Edinburgh caused us to miss again our connection and we had to wait for 7 hrs in Istanbul airport. Was forced to pay GBP 250 for 23 extra kilos and it was stated on the website 40kg allowance per person from Edinburgh - but they meant for outbound not inbound which wasn't clear. Terrible treatment in Istanbul Airport",Detractor
"I am disappointed with Turkish Airlines transit related services specially after they are promoting so heavily as a leading transit destination. I was travelling from Stuttgart to Mumbai via Istanbul on 16th December 2015. I missed my connecting flight in Istanbul due to the delay of the flight coming from Germany. I was put on the next flight scheduled to depart 24 hours later. In order to avail the hotel accommodation provided by the airline, I had to pay the e-visa fees in Turkey. I was told that this fee shall be reimbursed by the airline, but no process for the same was mentioned. Now I am trying to get in touch with the Turkish Airlines and they are absolutely unresponsive.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines from Cairo to Amsterdam via Istanbul, and the flight itself was fine once airborne, food and entertainment were standard. But the ground operation is shambolic. Our flight leaving Cairo was delayed for one hour. I understand that this happens and little can be done about it, but once we arrived in Istanbul there was zero assistance to help people make their onward transfers. There were no staff at the arrival gate to direct passengers or offer assistance to more elderly people who couldn't run (unlike ourselves- if we hadn't sprinted we wouldn't have made the next flight). We had to push to the front of the security line, whereas many other airlines escort you to the front if the connection time is tight. Our gate had just closed when we arrived, but still made the last bus to the plane. Although the plane then sat on the runway for another hour. In short, there may as well have been no ground staff in Istanbul they did so little. This would be semi-understandable in a small provincial airport, but this is their hub! To finish everything off, our bags were lost. They were eventually delivered to us 4 days later, soaking wet. Not damp - drenched. Every item in my bag was heavy with water, as if it had been left in a thunderstorm for hours. I will not be travelling with Turkish Airlines again.",Detractor
"I would like to show extreme dissatisfaction on the service I received during my recent experience with Turkish Airlines while coming back from Athens to Nairobi via Istanbul. We were to get a flight from Athens to Istanbul around 22:05 and then a connecting flight to Nairobi from Istanbul on 00:55. Much to our surprise when we reach at Athens airport at around 6:00om we came to know that the flight has been canceled. When I asked why we have not informed on the number we have mentioned on the ticket they declined to answer and asked us to get into a flight which was scheduled at 7pm. I was travelling with my wife and my 2.5 years daughter we actually had to run for check-in, security check, immigration etc as airline staff asked us to rush to get into the flight. Finally we reached to the gate but flight started after 8:30pm. We could not understand why we had been rushed for the formalities with a small baby. When we reached Istanbul, we have been informed that flight is late and eventually it was announced with the gate around 3:40am. We got into the bus and we had been taken to the aircraft but we had not been allowed to go out of the bus for almost 45 mins. Later on we had been taken back to the terminal and asked to wait. When we asked for the reason first they said that the Nairobi Airport is closed due to heavy snow fall which was an utter lie and later on the staff informed us that there is no Crew for the aircraft and it will take some time. We waited at the terminal without any assistance from anyone, sitting on the floor with the baby till 11am, and then they announced that flight has been cancelled and asked us to contact transfer desk. At transfer desk we had been given the new boarding passes and had been asked that next flight will be 0050 in the night which mean the whole day. I requested to give us some assistance as we have a baby and its very cold, but they refused to assist me in any way and later on just asked me to go away from the counter which was very rude. Later I took my own visa and booked the hotel by myself to go out so that we can have some rest. Later on next day when we landed at Nairobi all of our baggage were missing and there were no information. I had to follow-up with airport authorities and Turkish Airlines office daily to get my bags on the 6th after 4 days. The airport staff did not have normal empathy. I was at the airport for almost 12 hrs and did not even get an assistance of a blanket or a bottle of water.",Detractor
"We decided to go with Turkish Airlines this time from Boston to Karachi via Istanbul, over Emirates / Qatar Airways because of recent positive press. Never again. I don't understand how an airline can claim to be the new global hub airline, but then have absolutely no contingency plans in case of bad weather. As a result of snow in IST, hundreds of flights were cancelled, which is understandable. However, there were minimal ground crew available to assist, and frequent misdirection on the part of the crew who were present. Inflight, the crew on almost all four legs of our round-trip were surly and occasionally downright rude. The IFE was of pretty good technical quality, but quality of the programming was awful.",Passive
"First of all our flight from Islamabad was delayed for 5 hours - our flight to London had two stops, one at Baku and other at Istanbul. When we reached Baku we been told that we have to take another flight from here to Istanbul, when we arrived at terminal there was no Turkish Airline representative there - we wait for 30 mins, and they came he told us that our flight from Baku to Istanbul is cancelled and we have to take next flight in the morning. We stayed overnight at airport with 2 years old baby who was sick and my wife is expecting, but no hotel was offered. Next morning, staff at airport put us on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow and from Moscow to London, and when we arrived there we have no luggage - all our luggage was missing.

"Birmingham to Johannesburg via Istanbul return. My wife and I fly from Birmingham to South Africa with our 3 year old daughter quite frequently using Swiss, Lufthansa, KLM, Air France and Emirates. On this occasion we decided to try Turkish Airlines and while the service was okay in flight, we were shocked and disappointed with the complete chaos and lack of organisation we experienced from Turkish Airlines employees at Ataturk airport in the face of adverse weather conditions. After a 3 hour delay at Johannesburg airport, we arrived too late at Istanbul airport to catch our connecting flight to Birmingham and Ataturk airport was utter chaos and disorganisation. We were sent from one very long queue to another â€“ standing for hours with a 3 year old child after a long international flight â€“ no water was supplied or even available, no hospitality of any kind â€“ just chaos and more chaos. After 6 hours in queues in Ataturk airport, we were finally sent on a long bus ride to a hotel on the very opposite side of the city to the airport â€“ the Ramada Encore. Both my wife and I have missed a day's work as a result of the chaos at Ataturk and are very exhausted and distressed from the whole experience of flying Turkish.

"Houston to Mumbai via Istanbul return, flying Turkish Airlines for the first time. The outbound trip to India was smooth. But on the way back it was one of the mot horrific experience I had had. We checked in on time as per the rules from Mumbai. The flight was delayed by more than 3 hours. We inquired with he ground staff will we get the connecting flight to Houston from Istanbul, and they said yes. So we were on the way to Istanbul. The flight arrived late. There was nobody at the gate to let us know what we should be doing as your flight connections are not there. We went through the security again and by the time we reached the gate for Houston, they had closed the gate. When inquired with the person there he said gate closed now you go and look yourself what to do. We had no clue where to go. We went inquiring all over the airport, and the people or the staff there kept us sending up and down and left and right. In the end we saw a counter and we stood in that line at least to get in touch with someone authentic to talk to. The lady did not speak proper English, but somehow we got out boarding pass done for the flight for the next day. Now the problem starts, we asked the lady for or hotel stay as we have not missed the flight due to our negligence, but it was due to the airlines mess up. She said go to the hotel counter, but to get there we had to pass through passport control and we needed visa. So we had to pay for the visa which was not acceptable to us, because by now we had lost faith in the staff and the people around. So me and wife decided to stay put at the airport, not realizing the it was snowing and we will get shivery in the night. If you are traveling by Turkish Airlines be careful in Istanbul, as the staff there is very rude, not knowledgeable, and very unprofessional. To top it all my bags did not come on the fight. We are now receiving bags one by one in instalments.",Detractor

Onboard the crew looked really sleepy and the aircraft was showing its age.

"This was the fourth of four legs of a return Turkish Airlines trip from Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul, and one I'd like to forget. As a business class customer, priority boarding is promised, but at the gate it was a free-for-all. We eventually boarded but due to a computer problem we were delayed at the stand by almost 2 hours. The business class cabin was atrocious. The front of the cabin near the door was soaked in water, due to rain and a leaking sink. The taps in the sink were out of order so we had to rinse hands using bottled drinking water. Seats were economy style, with the middle seat free. When the passenger in front reclined, there was about 6-8 inches of room between the seat and my head, and the leg room was very cramped, knees touching the back of the seat in front once he reclined. There was no IFE, unless you call a sheet of sudoku puzzles entertainment. There were a few drop down screens which were used for the safety video. The screen was so dark it was impossible to see the images. First drink was served in a plastic cup. I am assuming that many of the passengers in business class were passengers from other cancelled flights, as our seat numbers were changed at the last minute (at the boarding gate). After take off, I waited until the seat belt light had gone off before unbuckling and going to the toilet. Once there the chief steward told me to sit back down as the light was still on - I can only assume he'd turned it off prematurely and then back on again after I'd walked to the toilet. I sat back down and waited for him to turn it off again. One passenger got up while the light was on and used the loo. I complained to the chief steward who said, he was ok to use it as he was about to turn the light off anyway. The same steward told another complaining passenger that if he didn't like the service he was more than welcome to leave the plane. I also complained that the lack of hygiene due to non-functioning washing facilities meant the plane wasn't fit for use. He dismissed my complaint. The leather covering of the raised seat arms were velcro-ed on, but the velcro had worn free leaving exposed dirty undersides. This is in no way business class standard - in fact it was less comfortable than economy (I travelled economy with a group to Kilimanjaro in October - that was a far more pleasant experience, despite a malfunctioning air con system leaving the cabin sweltering). The lounge at Istanbul is impressive, but be warned, the lack of their own lounges at other airports is a negative aspect of the experience. At Manchester, the Aspire lounge was in need of a good clean. At Kuala Lumpur the Premier Plaza lounge was packed to capacity, with lots of children and seats very close together. Wine is not included in the drinks service. Good points for business travellers include dedicated check in section and priority baggage loading and unloading. The lie-flat seats are ok (between Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul) and the food is ok. If you are looking for a true business class experience, I would highly recommend paying a bit more and going with another airline.",Detractor
"Terrible customer service experience. My Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Madrid was cancelled, and the next flight delayed 4 hours. Turkish Airlines staff employees in Istanbul are arrogant, treat customers badly, speak bad english, scream at customers, don't give concise answers, and are difficult to locate during delays. The call center puts you on hold for hours. The cabin staff is much better. Planes are usually okay, although some are old planes without AVOD. The risks of things going wrong with Turkish Airlines are high. Don't risk your time and vacations.",Detractor

We had to queue up to get new boarding passes and the incompetent tickets clerk issued 8 boarding passes instead of 9 - and issued the same seat for 2 passengers!

Upon arriving Istanbul I missed my connecting flight to the UK. I had to wait 19 hours at the airport. No one gave me directions on what to do or where to sleep or get food. I was basically at the mercy of Turkish Airlines to get home. I arrived London Gatwick on 2nd January having spent my new year stranded at Istanbul Airport.

Stranded at airports twice, took me 5 days to get to my destination (normally should be a day) and my baggage is lost. Staff was rude and unhelpful. Most barely spoke English and were unhelpful and rude. Cabin crew were mere waitresses only - 'I don't know' was their usual answer to every question that wasn't food related. On that note, food was nothing special. On top of that, their call center is bad - they are incompetent, don't know how to handle customer complaints.

"Tel Aviv to Accra via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines does not have its act together. My family was stuck in Istanbul for four days. The first day, we missed our connecting flight because 1 inch of snow caused our flight to be five hours delayed. We wandered around the airport for several hours, looking for employees that could not be found easily. When employees were located, they did not have accurate information to let us know how to deal with our problem. When we finally figured out where we needed to go to get our ticket reissued for the next flight (the following day), we had to wait in a 5-hour line to have it reissued. At the end of the line, our ticket was begrudgingly reissued by rude employees. The flight they rebooked us on was cancelled the next day. That led to more 3-5 hour lines and more rude Turkish Airlines employees. When we came back the next day for our flight, it was overbooked, and they did not get us on the flight. Finally, on day four we were put on a flight and actually arrived at our destination and they lost our luggage. The main problem is that in Istanbul they isolate all of their functions. You cannot go to one desk and get all of the help and information you need. Each desk only has one function and they are not even familiar with the functions of every other desk. They have fooled customers with relatively nice inflight amenities. However, ground services are awful. The worst I have ever experienced.",Detractor
"Manchester to Tokyo return via Istanbul. The inflight entertainment systems were great, seats comfy, food great on all the flights as well. My return flight from Tokyo to Istanbul when I booked was 11:40pm, with no communication from the airline this was moved to 10:40pm. I made the flight (barely) after turning up almost 2 hours early and there being next to nowhere to help someone new to such a large airport. The ground service and cabin service were very inconsistent, cabin service was average on all 4 flights. On the last flight I and the passenger next to me had to ask 3 times for a drink with our meal. The ground staff outside the UK seemed clueless at times as well.",Detractor
"Gatwick to Abuja return via Istanbul. Absolutely horrendous experience travelling with my wife and 2 year old son on this flight. First we had a 30 mins system shutdown at Gatwick upon check in. We got to Istanbul and delayed for almost 2 hours - no staff offered any explanation. Finally we boarded the plane to Abuja, on arrival no bags. 5 luggages did not come until 5 days later. I drove to the airport every night to check any inbound flights for my bag - after 6 nights we got my bags. By this time our Christmas holidays was already ruined. I thought, it can't happen again on our return trip to the UK, bit it did. The flight from Abuja to Istanbul arrived 1.5 hours late and we missed our connection flight and were put onto the next flight. On arrival to Gatwick all our 4 luggages lost again. It's been 3 days now and no explanation. I just got in from work now and saw that 1 bag has been delivered - 3 more to go. Fly Turkish Airlines at your peril.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines from Dublin to Abu Dhabi via Istanbul. From start to finish this airline was disastrous. My flight was supposed to depart from Dublin at 11.10am on 1st January - we did not depart until 5.08pm. We were sitting on the runway for almost 3.5 hours. We were given cold food and no explanation. Arrived in Istanbul to be met by chaos. My flight had already departed for Abu Dhabi and I queued for over 7 hours just to get a new boarding card and hotel room for a couple of hours. The airport was completely understaffed and staff members were very unhelpful. After queuing for 5 hours they asked me to go to another desk for a boarding card. Completely unacceptable! When I arrived back in the airport after 5 hours rest in hotel I checked in and went to my gate to be met with information that the flight was delayed. We were not given any information as to why this was delayed. I arrived in Abu Dhabi 1 hour 20 minutes late, to discover my suitcase had not been on my flight. It has been 2 days now and still I have not received my luggage. I will certainly not be flying with Turkish Airlines again.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines was one of the worst experiences I have ever had. We arrived from Tehran in Istanbul at 12 am, where it was one big mess. We were supposed to fly to Amsterdam an hour later, which never happened. For three days we had to stay in 4-5 hour lines for a ticket to Amsterdam. They were not giving any helpful solution. The first date after 7 hours standing in lines, they gave us a boarding pass for a flight that was canceled the next day. The next day the gave us a ticket for a flight that was already full the day after. Finally after an hour of arguing with their manager, the 3rd day we got a flight back to Amsterdam at the end of the day. Keep the long story short, instead of having transparency and communicating the issues with the clients, they were hiding the issues, not giving all the choices we had for flying back etc. Just sending us from one desk to another.",Detractor
"We missed our Turkish Airlines flight to Berlin from Istanbul due to the delay from Ankara because of snow fall. When we arrived in Istanbul they transferred us to a further flight, which was again delayed multiple hours. In the return flight there was again a 1 hr delay from Berlin for no appearent reason. They changed our tickets to a later flight for Ankara. I will be surprised if it won't be delayed also.",Detractor
"Beijing to Barcelona via Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. When we arrived at the airport for our 12:50 am flight, we went to check in to learn our flight had been delayed until 430am because the crew had worked overtime. At that point I asked why weren't we notified so we could have stayed at our hotel longer and not have had to sleep at the airport. Their response was that they still had to check everyone in at the normal time, which I find absurd. After waiting for two hours they offered us sandwiches. At 4.30 the pilots had arrived and boarded the plane, remember we were told we'd be taking off at 4.30. 20 minutes later the cabin crew arrived. We didn't start boarding until 5.20. The plane didn't take off until 6, an hour and a half later than what we were told it would be. What bothered me more is that at no point were we apologized to for the inconvenience. I felt completely powerless and mistreated flying with Turkish airlines. I won't ever fly with them again.",Detractor
"Athens to Lyon via Istanbul, and Turkish Airlines is a very bad and unprofessional company when there is trouble. I was stuck in Istanbul because of the snow for 30 hours and got no information, no food or suficient water. It was a total chaos and I had to wait in line for nearly 6hours just to get another plane as my plane was cancelled. Then they lost my luggage and I have no news of it, they keep saying they can't know were it is although I have the luggage number and did the right reclamation. Unbelievable!",Detractor
"I was flying Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Bilbao via Istanbul. Obviously my flight was delayed, as every single flight was with Turkish Airlines. Got to Istanbul and it was a complete chaos when I found out I lost my conection flight. The service provided was terrible, I did not know where to go or who to talk to. After 3 hours of trying to talk to someone in charge, I decided to go to the main office, outside the airport. There, a person found a flight to Paris, and from there to Bilbao. I took 4 flight with turkish, never on time, the service is terrible, and they dont provide solutions to any problem. They wanted to send me back home the next day, but I refused. Obviously I'm never flying with them again.",Detractor
"After snow fall on New Years Eve, on Jan 1st we checked prior driving to the airport the airport departure information and found no information on delays or any problems whatsoever. We then drove through beautiful weather to the airport. There we found total chaos: About 20 to 30 flights had been cancelled. At 11.00 our flight (TK0786 to Tel Aviv at 12.20) was marked as cancelled too, almost all other flights where delayed. The Turkish Airline transfer desk had kilometer-long lines, and after waiting and pushing for many hours, all they did there was copy passports. Then we were sent to the ticket counter, again km long lines. We did finally arrive in Tel Aviv with 11 hours delay. But our luggage had been lost. Now, 3 days later, still no news about our luggage. And guess what, the service number of Turkish Airlines in Tel Aviv is engaged constantly. Durning the 10 hours of queing and being pushed around there was no anouncement of appology, no public appeal through the intercom system, no drinks were offered, no assistance to disabled people was arranged, no special treatment for families with pregnant woman or little children was offered. Turkish Airlines did not seem to make any effort whatsoever to put some substance to their solgan ""we are the most popular airline"". They let their own few staff members who were trying to handle the situation down badly. They had to stand on the table tops and shout into the crowd all day to prevent being squashed by the thousands of people. And now, on Jan 4th in the afternoon our luggage has still not arrived. Any more news!?",Detractor
"Our Turkish Airlines flight from Mombasa to Istanbul (via Addis Ababa) was delayed. On arrival into Istanbul we had to queue for 2 hours to collect our boarding pass for our connecting flight. This meant we missed our connecting flight to London Heathrow. When we finally arrived at the front of the desk the man was very unhelpful and arrogant. He said he could not help us and that we must go to the ticket sales desk to rebook our flight. The process of getting a boarding pass should not take more than 2 hours! We were told that the flight had gone without us and that we must purchase a visa and exit the airport to go to the ticket sales desk to get a new ticket. After a further hour we arrived at the ticket sales office. We then queued for a further 4 hours (where people were fainting, arguing and children were being sick) we finally reached the desk. We were told that there were no flights to anywhere in the UK for 2 more days. Our return destination was not possible so we had to change our return destination to Manchester. After this, we were told we could collect our luggage from the lost luggage area. After waiting a further hour, the staff told us it was impossible to get our bags and were unhelpful. As a result we still have no luggage. After this we had to join the hotel booking queue which took another hour. We have been left with no luggage, no clothes, no toothbrush, no toiletries and no warm clothes in a snowy environment. The customer service for Turkish Airlines at Istanbul airport has been the worst experience of our lives. The airline have been completely disorganised, unhelpful and at times very rude. The staff are unprepared and spoke minimal English. People should not have to wait in queues for hours without being provided water or seating. People with children were not assisted appropriately. We were treated like dogs for a problem that could have been sorted appropriately and efficiently. We hope that our flight tomorrow is on time. We have missed 2 days of work which we want compensation for. We also have a car parked at Heathrow airport (our original destination) which we will have to try and get as our destination was changed due to their incompetence. We will never fly with Turkish Airlines again. I cannot believe they have been voted the best airline in Europe. The way they have treated people is disgusting and an outrage. We hope they are ashamed of their service. We just hope our luggage turns up eventually",Detractor
"Kayresi to Hong Kong via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. After 33+hrs domestic flight delay plus 2+ hrs international flight delay, I'm home after 50+ hrs - they totally ruined my 2015 New Year eve! Thousand of passengers lining up in front of their counters have similar awful experiences, pointed to wrong line (every line have to line up over a hours or couple of hours), the staff brought up other passengers who can speak Turkish to cut the line, given out wrong information, said they don't speak English after 5 minutes conversation. The rudest staff I have seen among traveled many cities. I will never fly with this horrible airline again!",Detractor
"Flight from Istanbul to Athens on Sunday 12.05, I was unable to use the Automatic check-in, because there was an error message ""No Seats Available"". A kind employee suggested that I should ask at the Administration desks, where of course there were more people waiting from different flights with all kinds of problems, due to the bad weather and cancellations. After about 35 mins, I gave my ID and I was told, even without apologies, that my possibilities to board were 50-50, because I was late to check-in, and there were some extra tickets sold. Further explanations were not given, but my guess is that they thought on this bad weather some people will not make it to the airport (as it happened ) so why can't we sell some extra tickets for more profit? I arrived at the gate and I gave my non-seat Boarding Pass, and I was been told to wait. I discovered that there were 3 more people with the same problem as mine. After the last passenger boarded, we would have to take the bus leading to the airplane, and wait again, until all passengers were counted, so they were making sure that there were available seats. Finally, we were told to enter the plane and take our seats, but this unrest is not justified by an airline such as the one I used. I hope this will be the last time something like that happened.",Detractor
"Dublin to Jakarta via Istanbul. A total shamble, missed the connection at Istanbul due to a slot time for the first flight. Turkish Airlines did not provide direct plane to plane bus transfers. Had they done so many would have been able to make connections. Once inside the terminal the staff rebooked on the next flight 24 hours later. The following night that flight was delayed and delayed. The lounge monitors were inaccurate and the CIP lounge staff incompetent. No information, no announcements, no service. They refused to rebook onto other airlines and failed to deal with customers properly. When we finally got on our way we arrived 34 hours late. As to the long haul flight: avoid the A330-200. The seats are old and uncomfortable (angled and not lie flat) and the IFE is unresponsive. This is not a premium airline. Every time there is a slightest problem Turkish Airlines miserably fail at customer service.",Detractor
"Cairo to Washington DC via Istanbul. We were catching a connecting flight in Istanbul and due to weather conditions, our flight was delayed nearly 4 hours. Once we arrived, we ran to our gate just missing the flight. Bad weather, delays and cancellations can happen to any airline. What was disappointing was how this situation was handled by Turkish Airlines staff. It was total chaos with lack of communication, poor management, and staff unwilling to provide assistance. It was difficult to find someone who could speak English and when you did, they were rude and condescending. We waited for over 7 hours at the transfer desk to get another flight. We were told the airline would provide us with hotel accommodations, but we were shocked at the length of the line requiring another 5 to 6 hour wait. Eventually we paid for our own accommodation. I was horrified by the way customers' escalating anger and in some cases, medical emergencies were handled or in this case, mishandled. While waiting in line, we witnessed at least 3 physical fights, two people who fainted, and customer service representatives who were in desperate need of proper training. I have flown with this airline on two other occasions without problems, but Turkish Airlines certainly cracked under pressure.",Detractor
"The holiday started quite well with our first flight from Manchester to Istanbul with reasonable seats for our 4 hour flight, even though the seat television wasn't working, an ipad solved this problem. We were expecting the same or better for our next flights on the longest leg (9 hours) from Istanbul to Bangkok, but were very disappointed to have less leg room and with the seat in front reclined couldn't even eat the meal properly. On the return flight from Bangkok to Istanbul we were told we would be delayed for 2 hours 30 mins, then held on the runway in Istanbul for a further 30 minutes due to congestion and only just made our connecting flight to Manchester. Unfortunately no luggage made it with the passengers. Both return flights had very little leg room and were the smallest legroom seats we have had on long haul flights - less than 1 hour internal flights within Thailand. The staff were very unhelpful when asked for most basic requests and very rarely smiled. We looked at the reviews for Turkish Airlines and expected a good flight, but were very disappointed. It is now the 3rd of January, some 12 hours after our return and still no news of all of our 6 items of luggage. All in all very disappointing airline.",Detractor

"London to Istanbul. My bag was lost by Turkish Airlines on the 28th of December. Airport staff said my bag would be returned to me the next day. It did not arrive. I was told that it had been given to a company called ABS Kargo. Two days later, the courier called me and I had to get a Turkish friend to talk to him as he spoke no English (not his fault but you'd think Turkish Airlines would use a company that was able to comunicate effectively) and was told he could not find my address. My friend gave the courier my work address and I was assured the bag would arrive the following day. It did not. Days passed and the courier turned his phone off and was not contactable. During this time I was calling Turkish Airlines every day and was told they could not speak to the courier firm on my behalf. I was told every day that my bag would arrive the next day. It did not. Eventually, following complaints on Twitter and by email I was called by Turkish Airlines to say my bag would arrive the following day - the 3rd of January - it did was damaged.",Detractor
"Munich to Singapore via Istanbul. Due to snow in IST all flights were delayed and I missed my connection. Snowfall happens and I understand this is not in the power of the airline. However the way to deal with difficult situations shows the real quality of the airline. Turkish Airlines fails at all levels. Flight is delayed by 4 hours, in reality you have to beg for a voucher, passengers are stuck and TK staff hide from the gates. To get information or vouchers one needs to go back through customs. Delayed arrival at IST airport, missed connection - no information is given, transfer desks have 3hr waiting queues. In reality it took 4 hours between delayed arrival and hotel checkin (at 6am) - surely this process can be improved. Make sure that passenger receive an apology, very simple, cheap and effective but this does not seem within the standards of TK. Overall this situation was very badly managed. Inflight I find Turkish Airlines a good airline but it is the whole customer experience that counts. I have seen other airline who are much more professional and prepared to crisis situations.",Detractor

"I've just had the worst experience of my traveling life, and it is not over. We (a couple and 5 year old) were due to fly out from Istanbul to London Gatwick on Wednesday with Turkish Airlines. Due to what would be a manageable snow storm elsewhere, we were first kept in the airport with a four hour delay. The area we were kept in was very crowded and not equipped to handle thousands of passengers they were bussing to the planes. Then we were kept in the plane for seven hours. Finally we were let off the plane. Once we got back to the airport we had to pass through customs and saw that they had made no allowances for the mess they themselves had created. Nobody seemed to know where we should go or what we should do. Then it was more waiting in various lines to get rebooked. Next day our flight was cancelled again. More lines and hours of waiting to rebook. Turkish Airlines has this ""amazing"" system where one cannot get rebooked at a check-in counter and instead has to go to a special desk called ""ticket sales"" to get rebooked. There are at most 10 of these desks throughout the airport, which were trying to process thousands of passengers yesterday. So after Turkish Airlines cancels your flight, they make you wait in line for hours for the privilege of getting rebooked. The fact that I am an Elite passenger (Star Alliance Gold) made no difference whatsoever. We are still stranded here - no seats available until Wednesday they say. And they make no compensation for hotels or food. Turkish Airlines should be ashamed of itself. After more queuing we managed to file a claim to get our luggage back but thus far no news of that either.",Detractor
"Birmingham to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul. The second leg from Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur was delayed for 5.5 hours. Queued at the Turkish Airlines care desk for 30 minutes, just to be brought directly to Burger King for a free meal. A free meal is probably OK, but the staff could have been more polite and friendly. He could barely speak English. There is no apology for the flight delay at all, no explanation as to why it was delayed. Really incompetent staff. On the flight, the food and drinks were good. The orange juice was fresh. Choices of movies were plenty. The air stewardess were not the friendliest, but at least they were quite fast in serving, unlike certain other airlines. I would not recommend this airline purely because of the 5.5 hours delay without any apology.",Detractor

The ground staff are few to handle the chaos. There is overbooking to Toronto, so we had to change the booking heading to Montreal instead of Toronto on the next day. The airport hotel is overbooked. The airline did not cover costs of my stay in Istanbul since we have to get in another 3 hrs waiting line just to ask for that, and you have to apply for Turkish visa.

We were well fed and food and drinks were excellent. The cabin attendants were pleasant and friendly. It was an excellent flight. Istanbul Airport was chaotic as usual and since I had a 19 hours connection time I was given a complimentary room at the Grand Cevahir Hotel in the city. I got a visa issued for 30 Euros. I was shocked at the rudeness of some of the immigration police at this airport. The hotel was very pleasant and comfortable with free transport and an excellent breakfast.

"Istanbul to Abu Dhabi with Turkish Airlines - total chaos again in IST due to snowfall resulting in delays. Can't blame TK for that. But as usual the handling of the crisis by TK ground services provider TGS was atrocious. Inadequate flight information screens in the lounge. Nearly missed my flight after waiting for 3 hours and having to ask the lounge reception about updates on the status of my flight every hour. On board, the usual incomprehensive cockpit announcement, with very little information. No landing cards loaded. The aircraft was one of the leased birds with a mixed cabin configuration in Business Class. I would recommend TK only to burn miles or on very cheap fares.",Detractor

I flew Turkish Airlines from London to Abuja on the 22nd December 2015 and upon landing I soon found out that more than half of my flights luggage was not on the plane, we did not get our luggage! The plane was full of luggage from a week ago, people who had landed a week ago and still hasn't received there luggage. I met people in the airport who had come in days ago also and hadn't gotten there luggage. It is now Saturday, 4 days after I arrived and still no luggage. There has been no apologies from the airline, no compensation, no remorse and a huge bunch of very angry people from various flights still waiting for luggage, wasting money going back and forth to the airport and still nothing.

"Excellent total experience with Turkish Airlines at a very good price from Birmingham to Kathmandu via IST. We booked our own flights with a package holiday. This meant we could fly from our local airport, get seats that were 2-4-2 rather than 3-3-3 for the long flight and save nearly Â£700. It was easy to book window seats on the left for a good view of the Himalayas on the way in - just phone them 99 days before the flight. I got through very easily (in contradiction to what other reviews say) and was treated with respect. No charge for seats. I chose 30A and B for the long flight to be behind the wings - they were good but a few seats further back would have been even better. Complementary food and drinks and was better than most airlines. You even get metal cutlery. Good, clean modern aircraft. Entertainment system worked fine on all 4 flights. Good cabin crew. The leg room was a bit limited on the short flight - as expected. Our flights back were from Delhi via Istanbul - same experience. I would use them again.",Promoter

We were served start to finish before economy was served drinks. (I went to the lav and the curtain was open.) I don't understand that. I paid for more room so I could sleep but not to be treated differently. The entertainment options were very good. I love being able to see out the front of the plane when in the airports. I also liked the hot towel, Turkish Delight, flight bags and blanket but I wish the blanket were washed rather than perfumed. The over-ear headphones were great. Of four flights only one was on time. I didn't miss any connections because the next flight was 2 hours late and I had a very long layover. I spoke with a young man who had an overnight layover in Istanbul. I don't know where he stayed but he sent me a text saying Turkish Air paid for his room! I don't know how comfortable it was but anything is better than the airport overnight! I've done that twice when US airlines kept us on the tarmac so long we missed our connections and the last rooms in town.",Promoter

Check in was pleasant and friendly, the cabin attendants were pleasant and very efficient. Food was well above average. We departed on schedule and landed early in Istanbul. We had to be bussed to the terminal and it's a long way. As I heard from many people Istanbul Airport is totally chaotic but that's nothing to do with the airline of course.

Agree with other reviews that staff does not speak much English and gives priority to Turkish passengers, across all classes of travel. Cockpit crews hardly communicate with passengers, and no relevant information, such as why a delay -0 only the few foreign pilots let you have the true picture! In addition, Turkish Airlines does not care about feedback any more, let them have our views on this website for next year's rating.",Passive
"We left from Seoul and while flying over Tibet the captain announced that the right wing engine was malfunctioning and that we had to emergency land in Beijing. After waiting on the taxiway for more than an hour and in the airport terminal for almost 2 hours, we were taken to a hotel with no english speaking staff. Because we didn't have a chance to exchange currency, and because it was past dinner time at the hotel, we could not eat. The airline staff also refused to answer questions regarding the plane or when the next flight would leave. The next day, after deciding that no help would come for us to the hotel, some passengers got cabs individually and went to Beijing International Airport, only to wait for another 3 hours until the staff showed up. There were over 100 passengers at the desk by then, and we demanded explanation. The 2 persons who came to represent Turkish Airlines just told us to give them our passports and final destination. My itinerary was 6 days in Turkey and 7 days in Italy. The staff took me and my wife to Lufthansa to board a plane which flew to Munich and then to Venice. They told us that our non-refundable hotel reservations in Turkey would be compensated by Turkish Airlines. That was the one question the staff answered. After we arrived in Venice, our bags did not arrive. They did not arrive for the whole 2 weeks which was the length of our honeymoon. After returning to Seoul, I tried calling Turkish Airlines. Their office in Seoul refused to respond, and their customer service call center in Romania could offer no help. I was referred to the online complaint system, and it has been more than 6 weeks since my report and still no response.",Detractor
"Bangkok to Tbilisi via Istanbul. Flights left close to on-time, the service was excellent - a real effort to attend to my every need. I really like the Turkish Airlines food. Fresh, perfectly balanced and healthy. And a good wine selection. I find the A330 lie-flat beds a bit narrow, I like to hear what the weather is the cities I'm landing in - something they don't provide, and I'm sick of arriving in Istanbul and having to bus to the terminal, especially when you taxi past numerous vacant airbridge bays.",Promoter
"Flight was delayed by 4 hours. We got to know it 1 hour before departure. The real reason is that the aircraft supposed to be used for that flight was delayed, coming from Tokyo Narita. How ever, when complaining to apply the European Rules of Civil Aviation, Turkish Airlines says it is ""Operational problems due to airport restriction"", which is beyond their control - they say. I'm really sorry but this is not what I want to hear. If Operational problems are beyond their control, then what is within their control? So they rejected any compensation, eventhough I missed my connection flight in Singapore, I had to spend one night in Singapore instead of taking my connecting flight to Denpasar, Bali. Really dissapointed on the fact that Turkish Airlines, even I am a very regular flyer with them, does not assume it's responsibility.",Detractor
"This was a Turkish Airlines connection flight on my way back from HKG (so HKG-IST-BRU). The last flight, IST-BRU, was really dissapointing (especially after a so good flight from HKG to IST). The airplane supposed to be used for that particular flight was normally, as every day, an A330-200 with their Business seat flat-bed, angle-free, 2x2x2 configuration. But unfortunately, in late minute, their plan changed. Probably due to the fact that the plane was not full at all (even the replacement plane, A321). The big dissapointement was when we entered this A321. It was a very old one, in 3x3 configuration, with no real business seat. So even we paid really expensive business class ticket, we got seated in Economy Seat, with the ""chance"" that we were only 2 person in a 3 seat row. But the leg-space was still really tight, and seat really narrow. Bad service, old plane, no screen or inflight entertainment, really bad seating for that price. In this case, I'm really wondering why paying 4 times the price of an economy ticket, while you get offered the exactly same service?! Expecting some answers from Turkish Airlines about that point.",Detractor
"Fantastic flight, on time, great lounge in HKG. Fantastic seat. Thanks for smiles of staff, great service and confort. I'm not always satisfied, but i have to admit that this flight was really good on the leg HKG to IST. The second leg, IST to BRU, was a complete other story - near the disaster. So bad that this airline is not stable to offer consistant, stable and without surprise good experience. Will write separate report about that connection flight IST to BRU.",Promoter
"I flew 10 international and 2 domestic flights with Turkish Airlines this year and they will likely be my last. Sure their planes are nice and new, but their service is getting worse every time I fly. Their customer service (online or via phone) has been pretty bad for a while, but now it's spreading to their in-flight services. The hostesses behave rudely to passengers raising their voices. They don't come right away when you push the call button. I waited an hour to get a cup of water on my last flight. This is unacceptable. The food on board used to be better. In the past I would actually look forward to eating it, but lately their food quality is slipping. On my last trip I wanted chicken but they ran out by the time they came to my row. Istanbul Ataturk Airport is very poorly operated. We are constantly transported by bus to and from the planes rather than boarding at a gate. My last trip it was raining and we got wet getting off the plane. The in-flight entertainment is decent. They have plenty of movies to watch, but not so many TV shows. I've flown so many times in 2015 that I actually ran out of things to watch. They need to update their library more often.",Detractor
"Gatwick to Seoul via Istanbul. My husband had flown with Turkish Airlines recently and had glowing reports, I was pleased to have had a similarly good experience. Seats in economy were very comfortable in all sectors and it was great to have IFE for the IST-LON routes. On our flight out, a passenger appeared to have passed away on the inbound IST-LGW flight so the flight was delayed by an hour. No information was given at LGW, but I was one of the few who might have figured out what had happened and I expect that most passengers would be more comfortable not knowing. Crew were welcoming and friendly but there were no forced smiles. It couldn't have been a great day for them but they showed utmost professionalism throughout the journey. Food was excellent, there was plenty to drink, flight was full. Not many toilets for Economy passengers, but they were well maintained and kept clean. Many of the passengers would not have made their connecting flights. I had a two hour transit window which was reduced to one hour. I walked purposefully (did not need to clear any security for this particular journey) and got to my gate as passengers were boarding. It was a long walk. I do not recommend a transit time of less than 2 hours with Turkish Airlines here. The next flight was also very full in economy but my seat was extremely comfortable and I appreciated the foot rests. Entertainment options were even more extensive than on my earlier flight. Food, again, was fantastic. I doubt any airline gives you better food in economy (better than some Business Class meals I've had). Unfortunately, about a third of the way into the flight I became ill. The crew swooped into action, called amongst the passengers for medical assistance and I had my pulse and blood pressure checked. Business class was a lot less busy than Economy and I was isolated from other passengers in a business class chair that had been turned into a bed for me. The crew kept a check on my throughout the rest of the flight and kept me hydrated. The worst of my illness passed by the time we arrived over South Korea and I took myself back to my Economy chair for landing. Thanks to the crew, I was left in a fit state to continue my journey (just needed an extra sick bag for the road). The flight back was less eventful but standards were just as high. The flight from ICN to IST was delayed by an hour. Again, I had a two hour transit window that was halved and I arrived at my gate for the IST-LHR flight as it was boarding. I really enjoyed my flights and appreciated the care and service I was given. I don't hesitate to recommend this airline but I do stress how important it is to have a long enough transit window to deal with an unforeseen delay. My husband will be travelling with TK again in January and is looking forward to it.",Promoter

"Istanbul to Zagreb on Turkish Airlines. Flight was smooth, we were little bit late with take-off because of very strong cross winds this day. Flight attendants were polite, but I noticed some of them are very bad in English. Turkish Airlines do not let passengers use headphones during take-off and landing. Flight attandant was angry with me, because she came 3x to tell me that I have to stop using my iPhone (on airlplane mode) during landing and take off - but on some other airlines this is allowed. Food and beverages are above other airlines economy class, so I can say Turkish Airlines have best Economy class. Inflight entertaiment was nice, 4 or 6 music channels, and some documentary was playing on LCD.",Promoter

"I flew Turkish Airlines business class from IST-YYZ, a 10+ hour flight. The in-flight entertainment system did not work throughout the flight. While overall service was decent, there seems to be an excessive focus on facilities that matter less (eg: on-board ""chefs""), than ensuring basic functionality on a long-haul flight. I would imagine that having a working IFE system would be critical regardless of class of service flown. Still surprised that no one from Turkish has either followed-up on my feedback from the in-flight survey they requested, or bothered to offer any sort of apology / refund / discount on the next flight, etc. Poor level of service on all counts.",Detractor
"San Francisco to Milan via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Check in was a nightmare. The gate employee didn't communicate seat information, and didn't respond to my concern that my bag would get lost (as it did twice in the past with Turkish Airlines). I spoke with two different managers on basic questions of Turkish Airlines policy, and they were just rude. Each of them asked me to repeat all the information I had already provided (an annoyingly obvious tactic to tire the customer), and then proceeded to quote policy unrelated to my question. Besides saying sir as if it were a four-letter word, and twice rolling their eyes (two different managers) with accompanying tone of condescension, one manager asked me ""are you on medication?"" Terrible service. Terrible quality. A mean, cynical, and dismissive handling of the customer. So much for Turkish Airlines Gold Premier service! I will never fly Turkish Airlines again, if I can help it.",Detractor

"Turkish Airlines from Delhi to Boston via Istanbul. I need assistance in the form of wheel chair for significant distance and have difficulty climbing stairs. I was traveling from Delhi to Boston on Nov 26th in seat 2D. When I arrived in Istanbul plane was parked well away from the gate. It took sometime to deplane us, in the lift there were more people than wheel chairs. I was offered to sit on stretcher which was too low to sit down. After coming to the gate the chair was provided. After significant time a chair arrived and again we were parked at a different place, finally we were picked up and arrived in the lounge 45 minutes latter. While my time for departure came no body showed up so I went to the desk and they called, they came 15 minutes before boarding time. There was no lift to take us to plane which was parked about a mile away and it was raining.The porter asked me to go three flights down on slippery steps while he took hand luggage. He placed me in the bus and said somebody will help me on getting in the plane. On arrival I walked to the stairs with my carry on and started looking for help.

An uneventful flight despite being very delayed in Istanbul and catching my London flight with only minutes to spare. I always listen to the safety brief, check the nearest exit, the number of seats between me and the exit, and for the life jacket. The disappearance of life jackets is common among airlines as people have been known to steal them as a souvenir.",Passive

I arrived at Bush 8:30pm there was virtually no line. Check in staff polite and courteous and felt genuine. Then it 15min to go through security to my gate. When entering the plane staff greeted everyone, making eye contact as they said hello. I was in seat 11K right in front of the bulkhead. My entertainment monitor was not working so I hit my attendant bell twice and no came, I had to wait 4ins after take off before I could flag someone down to come and take my complaint.

"Chicago to Dusseldorf via Istanbul. This was a classic case of high expectations colliding with miserably poor performance. I looked forward to the flight because I love Turkish food and have experienced the wonderful hospitality of the Turkish people. I flew to Istanbul and noticed I was invisible to Turkish Airlines staff. They focused their attention on their Turkish customers. I had a coat and draped over my knees and no one asked to hang it. After about an hour on my knees I finally asked someone to hang it. They also have an elaborate bed-making ritual that begins with a blue packet containing a pillow, blanket etc. They made the beds of their Turkish clientele, but my seat did not even have this packet, nor was I asked if I wanted my bed to be made. The food, however, was excellent. From Istanbul to Dusseldorf I experienced something I've only experienced in third-world travel: Flies. A host of flies bothered us the entire way. As they delivered trays of food, flies alighted on the food as it was being handed to us or placed on our trays. The return trip was worse. Flies again plagued us from Dusseldorf to Istanbul. But the worst service came with the person who issued boarding passes. She asked me if I wanted an aisle seat, and I said yes. I then added, ""I flew bulkhead from Istanbul to Dusseldorf and do not want to fly bulkhead again."" Her response ""Of course."" Imagine my shock when I discovered my 12 hour flight from Istanbul to Chicago was a bulkhead middle seat. What sort of perversity leads a person to ask a traveler, ""Would you like an aisle seat,"" and then give them a middle seat? Or acknowledge the bulkhead's lack of desirability, and then placing the passenger there for 12 hours? Turkish Airlines should come with this warning. No matter how cheap they make the cost of your flight, it is not worth it. The customer processing system went out of order in Istanbul prior to the flight to Chicago. Every ticket was manually logged using pen and paper. So, they held up the boarding of the flight, and sent down segments. Normally, you would expect the business class to go first, followed by the business class. Not in Turkey. The most important quality a passenger can have is being Turkish. So, the people who boarded first were people whose trip originated in Istanbul. Meaning, about 90% of the first boarders were locals. Then, once we encountered those who were checking boarding passes, complete chaos reigned. If I can avoid flying Turkish Airlines I will. It is just not worth the pain and perverse customer service.",Detractor

We flew business but there was no lounge (initially seated in CIP and then advised that this was not for Turkish) and were seated at a sectioned off area of the public restaurant. The greeting and food on board is very good but the service is incredibly slow. From boarding to getting a glass of wine took 2 hours. The seats were the most uncomfortable business seats I have experienced. They are not flat and the bottom section is flexible - horrible. My entertainment system was temperamental. On the return flight the toilet floor was really dirty. The Istanbul London leg was on a different model of plane with good seats and entertainment system. I am not sure if I would book Turkish Business Class again. All four legs were delayed.",Passive
"Nuremberg to Izmir via Istanbul. This was the second time I flew with Turkish Airlines the same route and the second time we left more than 2 hours late from Nuremberg. Thus the connecting flight was impossible to be reached in time as you have to cross Istanbul AtatÃ¼rk Airport and pass again baggage checks and passport control. The ground staff was inpolite and not communicative - they just issued another ticket for the next plane and surrendered it without a single word. I wrote to Turkish Airlines and explained the situation - they would check and come back to me. Reminding them about the outstanding complaint several times I received an unreadable standard excuse 4 weeks later and they would be glad to welcoming me again. Talking to friends who also came via Turkish Airlines from other German destinations I found that they encountered the same problems at this Airport. Turkish Airlines simply ignores time problems and is unable to organize a smoother transit in Istanbul. Definitely choose another airline for my frequent trips to Izmir. By the way, should you raise your complaint via Facebook - you will be friendly invited to use your individual case number on their website and never hear from them again. What a polished way to ease complaints.",Detractor

Main negative point is that on daytime flights from Asia to Europe they make the cabin fully dark for +8 hours.

"Istanbul to Casablanca with Turkish Airlines. Check in was easy, and dedicated passport queue perfect. Boarding process was painful, as the ground services staff tried to squeeze as many passengers onto the bus as possible. The bus driver drove quite fast and turned corners really fast which made some passengers collide with each other creating an unsafe situation. The onboard experience was okay apart from the very limited entertainment. The inflight entertainment had only a few movies and tv shows and didn't reflect the usual offering. Food was fine and cabin crew were mostly friendly. Some instructions on how to open and lock the toilet door and to flush the toilet in the safety video would be really helpful for flights to Middle East and North African countries because many passengers on these flights have trouble to perform these tasks. I think this would make the passenger experience better and assist the Flight Attendants.",Passive
"Travelled from New York JFK to Dubai via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. The comfort in Business Class is not bad, but on the shorter flights from/to Istanbul/Dubai (A330), the seat does not properly recline to a 180 degree position. As far as service is concerned, Turkish Airlines is trying, but just not getting there. That a meal consist of 3 courses is not too difficult to understand, so why some passengers ended up (on each flight!) with a starter but no ""afters"" or vice versa is not clear to me. Also, when your glass or cup is empty, it is usually promptly taken away (instead of offering a refill). Because of its competitive price, Turkish Airlines is definitely worth considering, but make some allowances. Check in in Istanbul is totally chaotic. No difference between business and economy passengers, and if you have children or need a wheelchair, don't expect any preference (because you don't get it).",Passive

Airport, lounges, seats, and entertainment system are good, but service is mediocre or bad, ie. boarding process, through the flight, and customer service. On this flight, boarding was messy and chaotic. Once we took off I tried to watch a movie but the screen kept shifting between modes and disrupting the movie. The attendant had no idea what to do. He tried restarting but that didn't fix anything. He didn't offer any apologies or even a fake attempt to compensate through special courtesy service. One good aspect was free wi-fi for business class travelers. I must say that's a feature that I was immensely thankful for especially with my malfunctioning screen. And the wi-fi worked without a hitch throughout the flight. Turkish Airlines may aspire to be a top-tier airlines, but its service is far from reaching that level.",Passive

Our plane had a technical fault and we had to land soon after take off on the first leg of our journey. There was a complete lack of information due to the announcement's being unintelligible. We had to ask for water as we sat on the tarmac for nearly three hours and no refreshment was forthcoming. We missed our connecting flight and found cabin crew and ground crew incredibly unhelpful. We were treated badly at the airport and had to fight to get our luggage for the 24hr delay. We needed our luggage for medical supplies. We were also charged $20 a person (11 of us) for Turkish visas even though we were only there for a night and due to no fault of our own. The Hotel was adequate for the night but again we found the staff rude and inefficient. When we eventually got to Male one of our parties suitcase was ripped and torn and my husbands luggage didn't arrive. This caused us a whole new set of problems again because of medical needs.

Upon checking in in at Bangkok for the return leg, the check-in staff gave us back a make up bag which they had found left behind at our seat on our inbound flight. All flights on time - the scale of their operation from Istanbul is mind blowing. If I have to complain it would be the ground handling in Istanbul - we were a group of 5 and because of a rescheduling, our pre assigned seats had gone.

The staff also had a hard time understanding and speaking English. The ladies in their customer service call center are unhelpful and one was very rude. I had to call several times due to many issues, and each phone call was much longer than it should be because of the language barrier and their unwillingness to simply do their job. The business lounge at Istanbul airport is beautiful - made ugly by the rude staff. Extremely unhelpful. A man beside us asked for the wi-fi password (after he just sat down, unpacked, hooked up his electronics) and the lounge staff rudely told him to go ask at the desk. The wi-fi password was on a table tent on the very table. Close to my flight time, I went to ask the concierge about my boarding time and flight gate (since it wasn't on the ticket), she pointed at the ticked in my hand and condescendingly asked ""you cannot read?"".

I wanted Orange juice and that was also finished. There was no apology, just a simple, ""Its finished"". I returned the vegetarian pasta and nothing else was given as a supplement. Online check in service did not work for me. Maybe because I got my ticket through a travel agency, I could not do online check in. I was then given a seat that was a bit tight ( I am 6 ""4). I asked the desk officer on my departure if I could be given a better seat, possibly an exit and he said ""My boss will query me if I give you"". He ended up giving me because I appealed and shortly before take off, he came and gave me another boarding pass in the lounge reminding me he told me he could get into trouble for assisting me. The most interesting thing is that the flight times are not convenient.

We flew with our 5 months old son so just after boarding was completed we asked a crew member if there was a free seat somewhere else. Fortunately one seat three rows behind us was free so the flight attendant asked the passenger sitting next to us to change the sit there. So we had three seats for us and our son hadn't to sit on the lap. Food was excellent. Prior to the main menu a Piece of turkish lokum has been served which was delicious.

"Kuala Lumpur to Istanbul in business class, 2 persons. We have travelled a lot of times with Turkish Airlines and always had the experience of flatbed. This time it was an old aircraft and the bed was not able to be like a flatbed. All the pictures we see of business class seats and beds had nothing to do with this experience we had here. Severel of the seats was broken, the tv screens was not too good. When we landed in Istanbul the plain was taxied to the reparations area. We were very disappointed over this flight. Though we love the food and the staff was very competent and friendly.",Passive
"New York JFK to Catania via Istanbul, and I chose Turkish Airlines because they had a competitive rate, good connection times, and great ratings. On my return home I was supposed to have a 1.5 hour layover and arrive home at 6 pm. They changed the flight and I had a 5 hour layover and arrived home at 11. And, waited well over an hour for my baggage. Worst experience and will never fly again.",Detractor
"I am a Emerald One World member. I fly weekly. I flew to Kiev on TK as it was the most direct carrier. On my way back from Kiev I had a 2 day stop over in Istanbul. To be honest I didn't want to visit Turkey as the experience with every staff member from check in, gate, cabin crew was terrible. The same experience on the return. Ignore call button, any request from anyone on the flight was an inconvenience. Didn't provide water regularly on an 11 hour flight. Fortunately this airline doesn't represent the people of Turkey. To the Govt. of Turkey, your legacy carrier is letting you down. To any One World members, you will be glad you are not a Star Alliance member..",Detractor
Checked in early for my flight at Vnukovo Airport. Good advice from the Turkish Airlines Office about changing my second flight. First flight took off and landed on time. A good meal was served shortly after takeoff. The second flight was going to be late (notified when checking in) and was even later. I was asleep before the flight took off and when I woke up later I was served dinner - it was sub standard for a business class meal. Luggage came off relatively early but my suitcase was wet and some of the contents were also wet (I managed to get things dry that day in Kathmandu). Ticket was purchased through a travel company at a heavily discounted rate. There was a small charge to change the date of my second flight but the advice received in Moscow was good and fair.,Passive
"I have always been a frequent traveler with Qatar Airways whenever possible. But this summer me and my wife decided to travel to Istanbul for a week long holiday and decided to try out Turkish Airlines. What a bad choice it was. Right from the start of the journey, all the flights were late. From CPH to IST, it was delayed by 3 hours and no explanations were provided. However it brought us to Istanbul in one piece and along with the luggage, so that was a bit or relief. The seat was good but the food was barely ok, as I don't think they were particularly fresh. But it was on our return trip they broke all the expectations. To begin with, the flight was delayed again by 3 hours. The ground staff were very rude and barely spoke English. We had some fragile items, which were properly packed, tagged and labeled. In addition to that, we had put on the Turkish Airlines fragile stickers as required by the ground staff. But it never arrived with us to CPH. After investigating, it was told to us that it was not loaded and will arrive next day. But when it arrived, it was not in one piece. One third of the things were broken and there were clear sing of mishandling and wear and tears as the package was scraped. We took pictures of the broken materials and the ripped package instantly in front of the delivery person and sent it to Turkish Airlines. But alas, it was of no use. They ignored our complaint. Not even replying to our email initially. We tried to call to the HQ in Istanbul and then they said they will look into it and later replied that they dont have any responsibility towards it, as it is fragile item so the owner bears the risk of any damage and not the Airlines. I have flown with many other Airlines in my quest of travelling over 50 countries but never have faced such poor customer service. I will never fly with them again.",Detractor

"My wife and I flew in Turkish Airlines premium economy from Toronto to Istanbul. Boarding was orderly and the flight left on time out of YYZ. Service on the outbound flight was good and the larger premium economy seats which recline allowed us to sleep on this night time flight. Food was above average. However, the return flight was not nearly so happy. The flight out of Istanbul was delayed (which happens) and there was chaos in the waiting hall. Then it turned out that the aircraft wasn't able to come to the bridge which meant we had to be bussed to the plane which was in the cargo area a long distance from the terminal. The ground crew never explained to us why the airplane couldn't come to the bridge. So all of the passengers had to walk to the end of the bridge and down fairly steep metal stairs to the tarmac. There were a number of elderly women who had a very difficult time negotiating the stairs and, so far as I could tell, they never got any assistance from airline staff. I ending up helping one older lady down the stairs. The return flight is during the day and after serving us a quite acceptable meal the flight attendants disappeared for about 6 hours. Based on my experience, I am not quite sure how Turkish earns the title of best airline in europe.",Passive

"Lahore to New York via Istanbul. I made sure before travelling Business class on Turkish Airlines that I will get a wide body plane in which the seat made into a flat bed, but they switched the Lahore to Istanbul plane to a 737 with narrow seats that did not make into bed. At Istanbul missed my connecting flight because the gate did not show on the Business Class monitors till late, and when I reached the gate they told me the passengers were just put on the last bus to the airplane and they could not get me on the plane. The staff was rude and unfriendly and told me that for me to get the next flight I had to get a visa and then go outside to the the ticketing office located in the airport and then re-enter. The Business Class help desk could not get me the boarding card for the next flight though I was paying them for the 350 euros for the new ticket. I had to change the date on my return flight and Turkish Airlines agent told me to they could not do it on the phone, and I had to come to their office which was a two hours drive, and it took them one hour to re-issue the new ticket at a cost of $105 surcharge. This airline has bad customer service and when I sent them a writtem complaint, they took two months to answer and said they are not at fault for any of my suffering.",Detractor
"Gatwick to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines was over 90 minutes late on outbound meaning I thought I'd miss connecting flight to Tbilisi, but somehow made it as the onward flight itself was about an hour late because of congestion at Istanbul Sabiha which seems not uncommon. Return flights were on time, in fact early into Gatwick. Planes comfortable and clean but food and beverage service just about adequate, nothing at all special. Tbilisi to Istanbul Sabiha was 0710 departure and breakfast was salad, roll and chocolate mousse, not at all appetising at that time of day. Crews friendly enough but only seemed to be 2 of them working in economy so meal service took forever. There was no separate drinks service and then meal on the longer flights to and from London, all served in one go. Got me there and back comfortably enough at reasonable fare but not quite up to what they trumpet themselves as being.",Passive
"Flew Turkish Airlines business class on this seven hour journey. The plane was old and the Business class seat was a little worn out. It was not a lie flat seat, and the controls were manual not powered. There was a push up foot rest, and the seat back could be pushed back at least to a 45 degree angle for snoozing. The seat width was okay, but overall not very relaxing experience. Lucky for us we flew during the daytime because I would have trouble sleeping well if it was a night flight. The food was adequate, not my taste. The cabin crew was very attentive though. One of the staff was dressed up in a chef's white tunic with white cap. He looked a bit out of place inside the cabin.",Passive

"Seoul to Toronto via Istanbul on October 20th 2015. First flight on Turkish Airlines Boeing 777-300 departure at 23:50. Rude Swissport staff handled the check-in. They informed me that they could not tag my luggage all the way to Toronto because my second flight was on Air Canada despite both airlines being part of Star Alliance and having code share agreement on the IST-YYZ flight. Sent to the China Eastern Lounge, nothing fancy about the lounge except an interesting cheese plate : a pile of Kraft Singles slices with Ritz crackers around it. Boarded the flight at 23:10. Comfort Class premium economy almost empty, seat rather comfortable except for the leg rest that is low. Two good meals on the 11 hour flight. We landed early at 4:45am in Istanbul. I had to collect my luggage that was not tagged directly to Canada. At passport control I was informed that a Transit Visa does not exist and that I needed to buy a 60$ / 90 days visa. I paid for the Visa, collected my bag and was out of customs in 10 minutes. I then went upstairs to the check-in area to find a deserted area with every seat crowded with people sleeping. Again, due to Turkish Airline stupid baggage rule, I had to wait from 5 am to 7:50 am for the Air Canada counter to open. I was checked-in to my preselected business class seat and baggage tagged in 45 seconds. I then went to passport control once again and waited for AC811 to Toronto. This very bad customer service experience really discredits Star Alliance.",Detractor

Staff were courteous and efficient, and they went out of their way to speak English to us. As mentioned earlier the food was delicious, served with attention to taste, and appearance. Since I was travelling with my husband I was delighted to be able to sit beside him rather than separated or angled away from him.

"My wife and I and baby daughter (1 year old) flew with Turkish Airlines from Dublin to Dammam via Istanbul in September. When I initially booked our flight I was informed basinettes could not be booked in advance but would be allocated at check-in. At Check-in at Dublin airport all basiinettes for the first leg of our journey from Dublin to Istanbul had already been taken which was annoying but ok with us. However, the second leg of the journey from Istanbul to Dammam, we were informed by the check-in person that she was unable to allocate the basinette seats for us since it had been 'closed' out from her system, even though this flight wasn't due to depart for another 13 hours. We were allocated seats for the second leg in row 29. On boarding the second flight I noticed that one set of basinettes seats were occupied by a man and woman who had no child with them. I brought this to the attention of the nearest cabin crew and she informed me that she would notify the senior purser. Of course nothing happened, no one came to me, no one offered an apology or an explanation. I made an online complaint about this and other issues also, to Turkish Airlines but got nowhere with them",Detractor

But yet they will book me a hotel room outside the airport. Very ridiculous and it make no sense. It's 6:28am and I have been here since 4:30am. Very tired and sleepy and I have 5 more hours to go. This is not acceptable I paid so much money for my comfort not for my stress.

"Entebbe to London via Istanbul. Loading at Entebbe was late and when got down to the airport apron a Turkish Airlines agent rushed up and asked what we were doing. The answer was, unsurprisingly, boarding the plane. He informed us all abruptly we should not be boarding and ushered us back to the door area we had just come out of. He told us to wait. It was pouring with rain. After 30 mins the passengers were wandering around the apron area (which was unsafe) while the aircraft was still being prepared (passengers who started their journey in Kigali had a one-and-half hour trust at Entebbe on the plane - that must have been a joy. Totally unprofessional attitude from the Turkish Airlines ground staff. On getting on the plane my seat, and other seats, in business class were covered in spare blankets and pillows. I asked for my seat area to be tidied up - I was glared and growled at by the steward. ""Do it yourself"" he said - I suggested that he should tidy the seat area for his passengers. Snack served if wanted after take off, but as was 4.00am most people slept. Breakfast was served just before landing. The transfer at IST was the usual shambles - other have reported on this. The flight Istanbul to London was OK. Food was good, but I just can't work out what the Chef on Board does. They don't cook anything. The airline moves people from A-B - it does not do it with a smile or grace. The advertisements the airline churn out obviously are very successful in that they have promoted a shoddy and smileless airline into a global brand. The airline has to depend on more than just good food - it has to be known for efficiency and friendliness of service on hte ground and in the air. Small bonus I arrived at LHR along with my luggage.",Detractor

Staff not very friendly and they do not speak very good English either. Food was good. Next leg was IST to ICN. Boarding was dramatic. Entering a bus that was fully packed. Privileges for Business Class passengers were absent and after a long bus ride, you can walk up to the plane. Business Class setup is 2-3-2, so luckily I did not book late which most likely would have resulted in being boxed in in the middle. Staff and food was consistent with the first leg. Not too friendly, poor English and good food. Seats are good, Flight entertainment average. The only thing that was exceptional (truly 5 stars) was the business lounge at IST airport.",Passive

I thought the service on the plane was great. We received snacks once the plane got in the air, hot towels, then a sleeping kit (socks, eyecover, slippers, toothbrush), dinner, then another meal about 2 hours before arrival. They handed out bottles of water periodically. We found the service to attentive and the entertainment options were endless. Every seat had big monitors with remotes. I would give them an 8/10--- the 2 missing points for the service outside of the actual flight. We couldn't print boarding passes at home, and waited about 45 minutes for bags once we arrived back at ORD. Additionally, we booked far in advance and couldn't view seats online and had to call customer service to pickout seats etc. That was a hard phone call given the accents etc.",Promoter
"We took off from Istanbul airport with 4 hours delay, instead of at 2:05AM, finally at around 6:00AM. But the main problem was the communication about the delay at the airport. They officially announced the 1 hour delay but when after the after 2 hours delay nothing happened the admitted the longer delay without saying anything about the cause. So during the whole 4 hours period of delay the passengers were kept at the gate without saying even a word of apology, without offering even the drink for refreshment, without even saying about the length and the reason of delay. On top of this the entertainment system onboard the plane was working just for the some passengers. The others were unlucky. We were a family of four and just 2 of us the system worked. The cabin crew just stated "" Sorry, it is an old aircraft"". Because of this approach towards the customers and because we missed also the following plane from Jakarta we raised a complaint but were completely refused. So Turkish Airlines never more.",Detractor

In all about 15 passengers were involved. The crew did nothing. No crew member even appeared to this mayhem unfolding and putting safety at risk. To make matters worse the cabin lights had been turned off (it was an early evening arrival) and the cabin was in semi darkness. These passengers commenced to move down the aircraft luggage in hand while the plane was moving to the gate. Finally, the head steward decided to issue a direction to them to return to their seats. This was ridiculous as she still had the annoying music playing and the cabin lights turned off. Finally after about another 5-7 minutes most of the passengers returned to their seats. The cabin staff failed to recognise the potential danger and take action. I was so angry that I let the captain know as I was departing the aircraft. Turkish Airlines, please take passenger safety seriously and train cabin staff how to deal with this type of behaviour.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines has good food, but the service could do with a bit of revamp. A smile in any language goes down well. Seems that Turkish Airlines depends on surly service. My luggage did not make it through the chaotic transfer at Istanbul Ataturk Airport and is still to arrive at Entebbe. The transfer at Istanbul is a shambles that does not reflect well on the airline or the image of Turkey. The first flight from London to Istanbul was a half full business class cabin with a flat bed. The six hour flight from Istanbul to Entebbe was in a very small and cramped business class cabin. No flat bed which was odd given the length and timing of the flight. On both flights crew vanished behind their curtain (which seemed important for them to keep firmly closed) to talk loudly after the food and drink service only to show their faces again when getting the plane ready for landing (curtain pulled back at the very possible last minute). Not sure the point of the Chef on board. Turkish Airlines use of the United Airlines lounge at Heathrow Terminal 2 which is lucky, given the 15-20 minute walk from the security area, near the TK boarding gate. No time to sample the lounge at Ataturk Airport given the botched transfer. Turkish Airlines ground handling agent at Entebbe Airport are well used to, it seems, dealing with multiple passengers with lost luggage. Three agents working on Turkish Airlines baggage issues at 3am! Not too sure how the airline wins awards. Seems to get passengers from A-B (in my case without luggage) without style or common courtesy. A poor reflection on Turkey's usually very friendly service industry.",Detractor

The seat did not recline and the movie I was watching was cut off mid-viewing. By the time they were able to rectify it, we were ready to land. Upon arrival, the luggage took forever to come out. Customarily, first and business class luggages should come out earlier. There were no difference on the domestic leg between Isranbul and Kayseri. Turkish Arlines need to renew their fleet.",Passive

The cabin staff spoke no German (on a route from Germany to Turkey) and little English, misunderstanding simple requests. Attendant call buttons went unanswered on several occasions. The food was of poor quality and only Turkish wine or French wine was offered. What the lady dressed as a chef was doing I really don't know.",Detractor

I have to travel with a 30kg box of test equipment and they do not know what to do with it. I had to go to the Turkish Airlines sales counter and check in counter 4 times before they got it right. If you ever have to call them, be sure to block off half your day to be on the phone and the other half to go to the sales office and half the next day to get it right. Terrible airline!",Detractor
"From boarding to deplaning, this is a very good airline. From reservations to boarding however, this is a poor airline. Shortcomings include a very weak online reservation system in that I could not select seats. I had to call three times to select seats - unacceptable! When you arrive or depart from IST, you may be transported to/from your plane via a bus. Upon arrival or deplaning of your aircraft, you have to navigate a flight of stairs exposed to the weather. Despite what airline staff tell you, if you are connecting through IST, you must leave yourself a bare minimum of 90 minutes to make your flight. Due to the possible great distance from one gate to another, at least 15 minutes transit time from your plane to the gate via their bus system, the lack of people movers, and the overcrowding of the airport itself, you risk missing your flight if you allow less than 90 minutes between flights. TK does not use a rope system similar to the one you encounter passing through security, at their check in desk and you can wait a very long time for what should be a quick process. Personal experience with connecting from arrival until I reached Gate 226 for my connecting flight (very last gate in the airport) took 50 minutes and I was allotted 60 minutes. Thus, I had difficulty finding a place for my one carry on piece.",Detractor
"We have been travelling Turkish Airlines business class from New York/Boston to Dhaka via Istanbul for the last three years. The timing suits us, and service had also been reasonably good. But the service had been going downhill for the last year. You don't get a boarding bridge at Istanbul, the airport is so chaotic. On June 4, 2015 we were scheduled to fly from Boston. We had fully confirmed business class tickets. When we arrived at the airport, we saw an incredible scene. The passengers and check in crew were shouting at each other, very close to an all out fight. Apparently, the airline had overbooked the business class and was unable to provide seats to us all. It got very ugly and the Turkish Airlines supervisor was trying to persuade passengers to either fly economy class or fly the next day. Very ugly situation because so many people were involved. They offer discount online and overbook, hoping there will be some last minute cancellation. When there are no cancellations, people are asked to fly economy or fly next day. Apparently, these happen quite frequently in Boston. Anyway, to get to my experience, we did not get our seat. They offered us hotel and flew us the next day. Faced with no alternative, we had to accept their offer and we flew the next day. Turkish Airlines also promised token compensation of money back, and double mileage earned. If overselling is truly their business model, obviously we need to look for alternative airline.",Detractor
"We flew Turkish Airlines from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt with a layover in Istanbul. First the service on the flight was terrible, I accidentally spilled hot coffee on my wife, the stewardess noticed it but couldnt care less (although it was burning hot, and my wife yelled), when I asked her for a napkin to clean the spilled coffee, she handed me 1 napkin without even asking if there is anything else she could do to help. That was only the beginning, due to late departure from Tel Aviv, we arrived late to Istnbul just to see our connecting flight push out of the gate (15 minutes earlier to take off time), we went to the Turkish Airlines desk, who told us we need to go to the transfer desk. When we got to the transfer desk, the clerk told us that we have been rebooked to a flight at 04:10, which meat that we had 9 hours wait. when I asked if they will give us a hotel room till the flight, we were informed that only if the delay is over 10 hours do they supply a hotel room. I asked to speak to a manager on duty to explain that the wait is 9 hours at night, we went to speak to a staff member but after letting us wait for 10 minutes he informed us that he is not a manager, and if we want to speak to one we need to go through immigration to the Turkish Airlines desk they will help us. We did so only to realize that there was nothing there. We needed to go back through immigration and went again to the desk to try to understand what we are expected to do in the 9 hours wait. The clerk informed us that we will be able to go to the Millennium lounge but only from 22:00 and until then we can get a complimentary meal from any restaurant in the terminal - which turned out to be false, only Burger king accepted the voucher for a lousy restricted basic meal. I can understand delays and re-booking, but I expect the airline will take responsibility for the delay and supply passengers a reasonable solution for their malfunction.",Detractor

Fantastic food and drink (eg. freshly squeased orange juice in Economy, perfectly cooked grilled fish, crispy skin, well balanced sauce), far better than any other airline I've travelled in economy. Good service with a smile. Seats are okay, similar to other airlines' economy. All flights on time and easy connection in Istanbul (short security queues, easier vs transfer in comparable airports like LHR, MAD, DXB). That said, I can see why they are building new airport, with dramatic expansion of Turkish Airlines recently, Istanbul Ataturk is packed (yet still efficient), meaning lots of off-stand parks and bussing to terminal.",Promoter

"Karachi to Istanbul to Chicago in February 2015: We took off on time. Istanbul Airport had snow and was shut, so re-routed to Ankara. Passengers from our flight were the first to arrive at the Ankara Transit Lounge and then came passengers from 7 other re-routed flights. Food was scarce. One sandwich and one cold drink in 10 hours. Snack store made money hand over fist. The worst part was that there were hardly any Turkish Airlines officials available to tell us that what the plan was. There were no public announcements about how long we will be there. People started to get angry not because they were stuck at the airport, they were angry because the Airline staff never bothered to tell us how long we will be stuck there. After about 10 hours of being in the transit lounge, they finally said we will be taken to a hotel for overnight stay. They said they will pay for the visa fee. We finally were herded to immigration and found out that we have to pay the visa fee and file for a reimbursement later. Some people had no $$s cash with them. Some people were very angry as $40 was a huge sum of money for them. After another two hours in the immigration line, we got our visas and were told that there are buses outside waiting to take us to hotel. Well, that was too good to be true. It took another 2.5 hours of standing in line in front of the terminal exit waiting for the buses to arrive/load. Finally we were got into a bus. On a positive note, the hotel was nice and dinner was free. At the hotel, one of the hotel staff told us that the passengers will have two choices in the morning: a 4 hour bus/train ride back to Istanbul airport. Once there, they will try to find a flight to get us out of the country, or possibly get us on a flight leaving from Ankara airport. I called United Airlines Global Services and they were able to get me a flight out of Ankara. I will not travel with Turkish again.",Detractor
A first class experience on my Turkish Airlines trip from Manchester to Bangkok via Istanbul. The cabin crew were excellent. Food as usual was very good. Seating was very comfy indeed. I have been flying with Turkish Airlines for over 15 years on this route and they have not misplaced my luggage. I arrived at Bangkok on time.,Promoter
"This was an older Turkish Airlines Boeing 777. Seat 1K in Business class, the footrest cushion had sagged in the middle. Very generous leg room but seat hardware and amenities are not up to date and not comparable to new generation of business class seats. Flat bed sleeping option worked (the crew made the bed) but the sit-up recline system was not working. Big video screen, but it IS so far from the seat that it was difficult to read small text. Crew courteous but lacked polish. Command of English WAS so so. Orders for first drinks were taken and then there was no drink service with the main meal. I eventually got some after making requests. Multiple food courses. Plating from the food trolley was done very professionally. Excellent food, probably the best in the industry. Good flavor and quantities. Fried eggs for breakfast - what a relief from airline omelettes! Clean toilet with fresh flowers and Turkish toiletries. Cumbersome to operate the entertainment system. Movie selection: mostly B+ grade movies, majority unknown titles. Overall a good product, amazing catering but they should upgrade the seat and more crew training.",Promoter
"The cabin temperatures were just right on my Turkish Airlines flights. VCE-IST was efficient, on time, gate agent fine. Second leg from Istanbul to San Francisco was a delayed departure. I looked around the Turkish Airlines lounge at Istanbul and it is as described, two floors, huge, lots going on, lots of food service. However, if flying Turkish Airlines you are going to get lots of food on the plane anyway so probably most helpful if you are using the lounge when flying nonbiz and have a pass/status. I personally prefer a smaller, quieter lounge but there's definitely the service here. Security for the connection to SFO from IST was heavier, including carry on search/testing and wanding everyone at the gate, so allow plenty of time at the gate. Lie flat seat was excellent, good bedding. I would never want the middle seat in business even with the good seat, and the Turkish Airlines Boeing 777 has middle seats in business class. Food and service very good. Chef only served/dealt with one aisle and FA's did ours",Promoter
"I was very pleased with my trip on Turkish Airlines from Helsinki to Istanbul and back. Seats were spacious in economy class. The plane from Helsinki had leather seats and had entertainment units in every seat with good selection of films. On return flight the seats were a bit smaller and no personal entertainment units, but a few bigger ones were in use. Turkish Airlines have the best foods of many airlines I have flown, and this time was no exception. The meals were delicious. I am also happy that for me their timetables have always kept well.",Promoter
"I should have trusted the Turkish Airlines reviews - it's clearly part of the customer experience with this airline, misplacing/mishandling customer's luggage. I won't complain about poor scheduling but not one plane was on time but that's minor. London to Uganda via Istanbul, 4/8 suitcases missing, a week later all bags finally accounted for but that's 1 week ruined. Uganda to London, 5/5 suitcases missing, 1 month later, 1 suitcase is still to be found. The food was excellent and the customer service was okay (I had to beg for a bottle of water when i was dehydrated from being in istanbul too long), but no matter how good the in-flight experience is, nothing defeats the purpose of an international flight more than getting there and finding your luggage didn't arrive with you. Why do we pay all that money for the ticket, for a promised service that is only half delivered. anyway, my lesson is it is better to spend more for an expensive airline that delivers in every way than risk your holiday experience on what in my opinion is a greedy enterprise.",Detractor
"It's not my first experience with Turkish Airlines, and to be honest about four years ago I was very happy with them. But my last trip was just unacceptable. I will not talk about service of the crew, it's well-known that they behave like you owe them something. To smile, to talk in a polite way or to offer some kind of assistance, it is not about them. The thing that made me upset that apart of that my luggage was opened, lock was broken, zipper and fabric cover were damaged. It happened during domestic flight from Antalya to Istanbul. Unfortunately, I've noticed that only when I arrived to Doha. I was very disappointed and I wrote a complain to Turkish Airlines. I was asking a simple explanation, but received only apologies, which they are using for all kind of complaints.",Detractor

"Flew Turkish Airlines from Manchester on A330 to Istanbul, the plane was a bit grubby with seat fabric stained. Seat legrest would not remain in raised position and lumbar support would not work correctly either. Flight departed on time at 11.15 and a meal was served almost immediately. It was very well presented and although quite simple was very tasty. What is the point of the chef? Cabins lights were dimmed and blinds closed immediately afterwards. No sign of cabin crew after that point. From Istanbul we flew to Ercan on a brand new A320, very nice except that the seat controls again did work properly, and because it was so new it needed both hands to extract the tray table from its location in the armrest. The meal again was well presented and quite acceptable. No chef on this flight and his absence was not really noticed. Boarding on both flights was a bit chaotic with a free for all at Istanbul.",Promoter
"Turkish Airlines is really a joke. I have tried for 4 days to get information about travelling with sports equipment. The hotline is not responding, the support at the Zurich Airport is not responding and the supposed Facebook support is not helping. You always get the same links to the site where any information can be found or the hotline which I have already contacted. Either they do not read questions or understand absolutely no English. My flights are now a 100â‚¬ more expensive and I still get no assistance about sports equipment. They simply do not answer me anymore. The worst support I've ever had.",Detractor
"Horrible service, will never fly Turkish Airlines again. I took a flight from Lyon to Taipei with a connecting flight in Istanbul. I was informed at check-in that my flight had been delayed 4 hours, upon further check at the airline's desk, I was informed that I had a choice to stay in Istanbul for 24 hours as there were no connecting flight due to the delay. The airline would provide lodging, transport to the hotel, and I only needed to apply for an evisa online. Up to this point the service had been slow but fine. This attitude had a 360 degree turn in Istanbul. As soon as I landed in Istanbul, a few passengers who would be staying at the provided hotel, myself included, tried to look for a way out of the airport and onto the shuttle bus. We were met with inefficient and unreasonable staff, my politeness was returned with unbelievably rude attitudes. We turned from counter to counter, with the staff giving us unhelpful directions. A counter lady near passport control informed another passenger that she needed a visa to get out of passport control. Frustrated of running at 3 in the morning with minimal sleep, I told her that I had a visa in which she continually urged that I needed a visa and finally, questioned my words when she asked with condescending demeanor whether I had the right visa. I took my visa through passport control where my documents and passport were thrown on the counter without response that I could leave. Still, I was lucky as I found out the next day, a few of the passengers had to stay at the airport (for more than 16 hours) because they had not been informed to apply for a visa in Lyon and after running around the airport once again trying to apply for a visa, was met with unhelpful staff and contradictory directions. Sadly, this was not the end of my nightmare. The insulting attitudes of the staff I had to bear when I asked for a certificate of delay at the airport before my flight was appalling. Again, I was turned from counter to counter (the staff seems not to have the ability to direct one to the right counter at first request) At my last stop I requested the certificate and explained my delay. Shockingly, the staff with scorn and disdain replied that my flight was not delayed, why or how did I believe it to be delayed? If it hadn't been delayed I would have been on my flight that second, not running madly around the airport struggling with airline staffsthat seems to despise and absurdly question the intellect of their customers. The breaking point came when he asked me why my flight had been delayed. No, the staff did not have the courtesy to tell me why my flight was delayed but had the audacity to put that question upon me. I have been very disappointed with Turkish Airlines on this horrendous trip. Through my encounters with the airline staff I felt insulted and laughed at. I question the credibility of an airline without efficiency, quality, and professionalism, to call itself one of the top airlines in the world.",Detractor
"I flew London to Ankara via Istanbul, and it is difficult to put into words how bad Turkish Airlines is. Their customer service desk at Istanbul seems designed to annoy as many people as possible in as shortest time as possible. We missed the connection because the first flight was delayed, and then I spent three hours in a line waiting to get a new flight. Despite having a business class ticket, I was turned away from the Business lounge and had to wait in the main terminal. The attitude of every Turkish Airlines staff member I spoke to was appalling.",Detractor

They did not complete the transaction in time and I missed their deadline to check in, requiring me to purchase another full fare ticket. This happened twice. If something happens, Turkish Airlines make it as difficult as possible to help you and it appears they are only trying to mess you up.

"The worst travel experience I had and I swear I will not fly Turkish Airlines again. I was traveling with my 9 year old daughter from Venice to Addis Ababa via Istanbul and there was a delay in our flight from Venice to Istanbul, which resulted in missing our connecting flight to Addis. This was not that surprising as I found out later it is very very likely to miss your connecting flight when you fly Turkish Airlines. Like everybody else, we went to the transfer desk and they put us on the next flight which is one day later. Next to the transfer desk there is a a place to make a free phone call to inform your family about the delay. This is where the trouble began, since there is a delay on almost every connecting flight they provide a single phone for all those people and there was a very long queue. We waited for about 2 hours on the queue and when there was only one person in front of me, this women came with one of the desk attendants and he let her to cut in front of me. I didn't think that was right and I complained and as he result he disconnect the telephone line and shut down everything, without caring even a bit about all those people on the line. The next step was to get a hotel to spend the night, which is located outside the airport and we need a visa to go out. The visa can be bought inside the airport but they refuse to accept our Ethiopian passport, and they demanded a resident permit from Italy. I had the permit card, with my daughters name included on the same card, it is the Italian immigration law that minors do not get independent permit card, but their name is included on one of the parents card. The Turkish police refused this and told me that I can get the visa but my daughter can't, which in my opinion a stupid police. When I try to get an explanation for such stupid rule, every one of them was giving me the same answer ""I don't know"". So we spent 24 hours inside the Istanbul airport, buying food with our own money. Even the people working at the food courts are very rude. The next day we boarded the aircraft on time but it took off 6 hours late, they even changed the entire cabin crew at one point. So we had a 30 hours delay in total. On our return flight we again missed our connecting flight but this time we waited only 3 hours for the next one. So you be the judge isn't Turkish Airlines the worst?",Detractor
"Paris to Cape Town via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. New plane on both legs. Excellent entertainment system and good leg room. Check in easy at Paris and boarding done smoothly. Cabin crew on both flights very attentive, bottle of water for overnight flight and answered call bells quickly. Food passable. Main problem is at Istanbul airport. It is now very busy and can feel chaotic. For both flights there - landing and taking off - we were bussed to and from the airport. This meant a long trip to and from the plane. The gate for the bus to the plane has a small waiting area, no clear means of lining up and no priority given to any passengers at all whether they were elderly, had small children or were in business. More the problem of the airport rather than the airline.",Promoter
"I flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to Bucharest. While I was waiting for dinner to be served I laid flat the table for the cabin attendant to place the meal on it. I was sitting by the window and I fell asleep, for maximum two minutes. The passenger sitting in the aisle seat next to me received her dinner but the flight attendant passed by me without leaving my dinner. She didn't even try to gently wake me up. When I woke up the flight attendant was two seats in front of me. I pressed the call button for someone to come see me and I also called out to the flight attendant, but she ignored me completely, unwilling to turn her head and look at me. I couldn't get out from my seat as the woman next to me was eating and didn't want to disturb her. Nobody came to see me to ask me what was that I needed despite the fact that I previously turned on the button. I was completely ignored, and left without dinner.",Detractor
"I was flying Turkish Airlines from Istambul to Bodrum, a domestic flight within Turkey. Despite the fact I purchased business class tickets (not just for this route, but also to and from Turkey), when showing up at check in, they simply said they would downgrade me, because of overbooking. The way they handled the whole situation, kept us waiting for a long time both at check in, and also at boarding, the whole inconvenience was simply terrible experience. They offered a EUR50 check as compensation and thought this would be fair. After returning home, I wrote a complaint for the airline and their reaction is as scandalous as their operations: ""Concerning the matter you raised in your message, passengers not showing up for their flights cause flights to take place with empty seats. For this reason, as does every airline, Turkish Airlines, too, sells more tickets than the number of seats on the aircraft, from time to time. This situation is called overbooking, and in the case that all the passengers booked show up, some of our passengers unfortunately are unable to fly on the same flight."" Hence they think by explaining me as stupid kid, what overbooking means, they think downgrading is a fair action on their side and that was it. I am a frequent business traveller, this attitude and customer service is outrageous and luckily not everyday routine with other airlines. By the way, same thing happened to fellow travellers also on our way back Bodrum-Istambul-Budapest. Not just they downgraded them because of overbooking (seems to be pretty common with Turkish Airlines) but one of my friends ticket was also deleted from their system. Never heard of anything like this before. When she presented the printed version of her ticket (luckily she had it with her), Turkish Airlines said their system shows that because of overbooking, she was not only downgraded, but also transferred to another flight 1 day earlier than the actual flight. It also showed, that she actually took the flight the day before! This is madness. I have decided never to use Turkish Airlines.",Detractor
"Turkish Airlines flight from Gatwick was delayed with 30mins on the screen. We were all ready to depart, but they kept us waiting for another 1h 30mins without any explanation.

We just arrived 30mins before my departure to Bangkok, with another 25 passengers for the same flight to BKK. A guy was waiting for us at the entrance and guide us to our gate which was very helpful and made us think that we will actually catch the flight. We all arrived 10 mins before departure, but they close the gates and didn't let us on, the most annoying thing that without any explanation we could even see that they let PAX board before us. So dissapointing, staff does not speak English and not helpful at all. They guide us to the ""care desk"" with the grumpiest stuff ever (I understand that they need to deal with angry and dissappointed passangers all day, but they behaviour was unacceptable). I gave my boarding card to the lady in same time as my flight was departing.. She just printed me another ticket for the next flight 5 hours later. No appologies no nothing.

"We had a flight on Turkish Airlines from Moscow to Manila via Istanbul. Because our flight to Istanbul was delayed, we missed my second flight to Manila. After some time spent in queues we discovered the next flight to Manila will be two days after and staff of Turkish Airlines gave us the option to go to Manila next day via Bangkok. They told us that we should wait in the airport till they book our tickets. So, we waited for 3 hours without any service and during this time the staff couldn't do it. Only when we found manager he told us that we can go to hotel service and get our tickets tomorrow, and by that time it will be booked. It seems that staff from Turkish Airlines who told us we should wait our tickets didn't know about such option. Next day we got our boarding passes to Bangkok, and staff told us that we should get our tickets from Bangkok to Manila on Turkish Airlines transfer desk in Bangkok. They didn't tell us anything about second flight - no time, no airline. We asked about this flight from Bangkok to Manila two times - the guy on registration desk and the girl on supervisor desk. We also asked about our luggage and they told us that it will be sent to Manila with us. When we arrived to Bangkok, we didn't find any transfer desk of Turkish Airlines). It took a long time to found someone from Turkish Airlines with help of airport service, and at that time it turned out that flight, booked by Turkish Airlines for us, passed some time ago. After long investigation with girl from Bangkok office of Turkish Airlines they booked us tickets to Manila for the second time. I should say the Bangkok office of Turkish Airlines were the only ones who really tried to help us.

"The trouble started at SIN itself when our onward journey from IST to LIS was cancelled without notification. Upon inquiring at the airport, we were told that the cancellation was a mistake and that the sector would be reinstated. Once the reinstatement happened, we got our boarding passes. Looking at the trouble that we had, I asked the Turkish Airlines staff to reconfirm our return flight from IST to SIN and we were even allotted seats 16 A/B. The leg space in A330 is poor and I have never ever experienced such uncomfortable seats. The seating in Boeing 737 is more normal and I did not have any issues from IST to LIS. On our way back, IST airport was chaotic. People were not maintaining the queues and check-in was the most unruly I have encountered. Once we reached the counter we were informed that the flight is full. I told the agent that it is good for TK and I just want my boarding pass. I got the boarding pass after some reluctance on the agents part. I did not give it much importance but as soon as we moved from the counter, I saw STB on our seat allocation. I went back and inquired and was informed that we have been put on Standby. Even after informing the agent that I have confirmed seats, she said that she is unable to help me and that I would be helped at the gate. At the gate, the agents told us that a supervisor is going to come to help us out. However for the entire boarding time, no one came and only when we started to get agitated did someone come. There were approx 9 passengers who were on standby and the supervisor let 2 of them board. Then they allowed my wife to board and I was told that there is no more spare seat. I was angry and credit to the supervisor, he was professional and sent his assistant to physically check inside the aircraft and they found an empty seat which was allocated to me. Even though I boarded the flight that I was supposed to, I was earmarked for standby as the tag on my delayed luggage proved later. This was unacceptable.",Detractor

Planes were new and seats where like any European business class (i.e. economy seating with an empty middle seat) with the exception of the Istanbul - Amsterdam leg where it was a proper business cabin. Service was good and the food very good as usual. The lounge in Istanbul was great and I believe is truly exceptional by any airline standard. Turkish Airlines are also very competitive in price since their business class ticket was only a few dollars more than KLM or EL AL in economy. Transit in Istanbul was surprisingly smooth but i would recommend at least a 4 hour layover. It is obvious that the airline has outgrown it home base a long time ago and the airport can barely keep up with the volume of traffic going through. All four flights were delayed by at least 45 minutes to one hour which seems to be a standard now for TK flights.,Passive

However due to a change of aircraft, the airline chaged our seats and gave our son a window seat for sure but with two strangers either side od him.

Food was again tasty but quantity not enough. Overall I enjoyed Turkish Airlines. It was better than expected but not as good as Qatar Airways and Emirates and that's mostly because of the crew.

The A330-300 to DXB was such an aircraft. The problem was that this plane was not made for TK. There is an personal screen but films were only available in arabic (even not in Turkish) and only 3 options are presented and normally the IFE is very good on TK long haul flights.

"My flight got cancelled due to technical issues and they booked me another flight the next day, with a different airline. They told me that they would send my baggage to my last destination, Boston. According to my flight, I was supposed to transit in Dubai.

Even worse, when I finally got to Boston, my baggage was lost.",Detractor
"I liked the ticket price for the flight from Ashgabat to Nicosia through Istanbul. Planes new with exciting backlight, clean with pleasant flight attendants on board.

Transit was short, I spent time at a cafÃ© in Istanbul airport.",Promoter
"Flew Turkish Airlines in mid-June. I am a loyal TK customer but this experience was a total let down and I have decided to switch to other carriers. The food is normally good, the lounge in Istanbul is excellent, but their service is deteriorating by the day. Old, dirty seats, no priority boarding, no access to lounges in smaller airports, finally they didn't load my special meal. When I complained through their online customer service system they were not apologetic, but on the contrary tried to justify and explain every fault. Moreover, delays of anywhere between 15-45 minutes are a normal occurrence. They don't even bother apologizing to customers. It's almost perceived as something totally acceptable. They really need to improve if they want to grow and sustain their business model.",Detractor
"Both on this journey, as well as going out (Manchester/Istanbul/Tashkent) the plane was late into Istanbul. In other countries of my experience (19 years in export sales) there would be assistance for the passengers in transit - to help them try to catch their onward connection. In the case of Turkish Airlines - nothing. For me an important aspect of the overall quality of an airline is not just the seats or the food, it is how that airline reacts to and lends assistance when things go wrong. For me, Turkish Airlines score zero.",Detractor
I have flown with TK a number of times long haul from Asia and found this experience a complete let down. As mich as I've reviewed the good I'm also going to review the bad. Considering that they are competing with Etihad on this route it is very disappointing to see the aircraft quality. Business class seating was falling apart so badly that you could see the metal poles beneath it on some seats. Headrests too were so uncomfortable as well. The food and staff were fantastic on the flight and I can't fault this at all but the rest of it I don't have anything to complain about at all. The TK lounge in Istanbul is phenomenal as well. Flight departures on both sectors has actually been delayed in excess of an hour with everyone sitting onboard waiting in hot stuffy temperatures. At least on the IST-BEG flight there was an additional drink service but the poor people in Y didn't get this. TK really needs to lift their game if they intend to start flying to Australia because at this rate they won't have very many travellers if they aren't going to improve their product and make it more consistent.,Detractor
"CGN-IST-GZT-IST-FRA with Turkish Airlines in August. CGN-IST with A320. Boarding smooth, seats cramped and uncomfortable. No IFE and overhead monitors not working. Cabin crew were friendly and food very tasty. IST-GZT with B737 delayed 40 min. The seats were better but no IFE, snack was served. GZT-IST with A320, delayed 40 min. IST-FRA with A321 was the best flight. Seat 8F at emergency exit door with big legspace. Very good IFE with working personal monitors. On the outbound flight my wife forgot her mobile phone at the CIP domestic lounge in Istanbul. The ground service saved it and we got it back at the lost and found desk. Overall a good experience but the cabin product in the aircraft is inconsistent and the seats are not always in a good condition.",Promoter
"BRU check in ok, fast track and the usual terrible overcrowed SN Brussels Airlines lounge. Boarding in BRU this time wonderfully ok. Flight in A330 excellent seating and IFE. Food is the same old story, I now order either religious or a fruit platter, which is done with zero imagination and also and usually very boring. Return leg, good check in and fab fast lane and passport control direct in the entrance of the lounge. Boarding a mess, which is very common with TK on BRU route. This time was unforgettable, because of the remote door, no priority boarding, so no place for my bag in any compartment of Business class. Some pax delayed boarding for 45 minutes. My request for a platter was not there either. I complained. Very good, young and friendly purser and c class cabin attendant was eager to help, which made it nicer.

"Our return leg back to Abuja from Heathrow was terrible. Me and my wife were issued just the boarding pass to Istanbul from Heathrow, while my son (2.5 years old) got boarding pass to Istanbul from Heathrow and Istanbul to Abuja. When I complained they said don't worry, jut pick it up when you get to Istanbul. We arrived Istanbul and someone from Turkish Airlines was announcing to us that passengers transiting to Abuja should go to the boarding gate immediately - we complained that we were not given boarding pass in Heathrow and the guy said go upstairs. We got upstairs at the Turkish Airlines desk told them we need boarding pass. After waiting for about 2 mins, I noticed the lady had a strange look on her face, unfortunately they don't speak good English, so off she went came back after about 2 minutes with someone who flatly told us, sorry you cannot board that plane. I asked him why, he said the plane has departed. He said the option we have is to either spend 48 hours in a Hotel in Istanbul, they'll take care of our hotel bills and food or we go via Egyptair that has a 6 hours wait in Istanbul, 8 hours wait in Cairo and a total of about 8 hours flight. We spent 6 hours wait time on a cold metal chair in Istanbul and 8 hours in Cairo. After a combined 8 hours flight from Istanbul to Abuja via Cairo, we finally arrived Abuja. We got to Abuja but all my checked in luggage could not be found. 5 days after arriving Abuja Turkish airline is telling me its the responsibility of Egyptair to find my luggage not theirs.

"I flew with Turkish Airlines many times inside Europe and received great service, flights, cabin crew, food. I decided to fly with them on long flight to Kuala Lumpur. Flight and service Budapest-Istanbul was like it should be. Istanbul to Kuala Lumpur and back the A330-300 has small space for legs (Boeing is better), they served food 2hrs after departure at 3AM, no smile on crew faces, slow service.

"Turkish Airlines night flight from Heathrow through Ataturk on my way to Bulgaria. Arriving in Ataturk around 4 AM, I waited for the gate indication for the 7:30 flight to Bulgaria. Around 5:30am, it opened, so I went to the gate and showed the pair of Turkish Airlines employees my boarding pass and sat down right in the front row of the departure lounge. Exhaustion took over and I slumped in my chair, jerking awake to see the bus leaving for the plane and the big red letters CLOSED. I jumped to the desk and asked the man why he did not call me or wake me up, when he knew I was on that flight. He simply smirked and said â€œNot my responsibilityâ€. I asked him what I should do, but he was determined to brush me off, simply saying â€œtry going upstairs to the transfer desk.â€ Well, that set off a chain of absurdity the likes of which I've never seen in my life. It seemed that every employee, either of Ataturk Airport or of Turkish Airlines, ranged from nonchalant to downright belligerent. I was sent on a wild goose chase from desk to desk to desk, with practically everyone having the â€œnot my responsibilityâ€ attitude. There was no solution at the â€œtransfer deskâ€, and they kept sending me to other desks in what began to feel like some kind of absurd hazing ritual. Finally, after running the gauntlet several times, I was informed that I would have to clear immigration to get to the Turkish Airlines sales desk in the airport. Supposedly that was the only path to a solution for my problem. I stood in line for over an hour to get stamped, but was told â€œYou need a Turkish visa.â€ Incredulous, on my way to the visa desk, I asked the same information clerk why he didn't tell me that I needed a visa, and he (I am not making this up) told me â€œYou didn't ask. It's not my responsibility to think for you.â€ At this point, I was choking back tears. I just couldn't believe it. I got back into line after paying 20 pounds for a visa and about an hour later finally got to the Turkish Airlines sales desk. The clerk informed me that it was â€œnot Turkish Airlines' problemâ€ that I was not notified of the boarding and that I would have to pay an additional 265 euros in order to be able to board the next available flight, which was twelve hours later. I thought that was extremely unfair, given that I was at the gate on time and had identified myself to the ground staff. I thought I had the right to be informed of the flight leaving and woken up. Nothing I said to them was received with any amount of comprehension, compassion, or understanding. They said that if I didn't like their solution, I could go to their â€œsupervisor's deskâ€ at counter B15. At counter B15, I waited and waited until I finally got to talk to the extremely annoyed agent, who curtly informed me that she was â€œnot authorizedâ€ to handle my request, and that I was welcome to call customer service at the help phone. The lady on the help phone was the most helpful out of anyone I had spoken to in a now 5-hour drama, but even she was only able to â€œmake a reportâ€. Long story short, I was forced to pay 178 euros to board the next flight, and when I got to Sofia that night, I saw that Turkish Airlines lost my luggage on top of everything. Three days later, I was informed that Turkish Airlines will not deliver my lost luggage, so I am forced to pay another 100 euros in taxis to get to the airport in Sofia to retrieve my things.",Detractor
"Both flights were okay and went smoothly, although I never thought my flight experience could be so greatly affected just by customer support! When we arrived in Istanbul (at almost midnight) we were informed that the airline would not be providing overnight accommodation (our next flight left about 13:40 the next day) because there was another flight coming from Rome in the morning - meaning it would have been possible for us to take that flight and not have as long of a layover. Not only did Turkish Airlines not tell us this until we arrived in Istanbul, they basically yelled this at us and then the agent walked away from the desk - worst customer service experience ever. Had we known this, I would have had no problem making hotel plans for that night prior to arriving of course but after experiencing this bad service we were then left to find a hotel for the night in a city we had never been to. It's a shame because the flight crew worked very hard at their jobs but our experience was ruined by poor service from the hotel desk.",Detractor
"Two flights to get us from Ankara to Athens. The first leg was to Istanbul. Online check-in worked and very fast service at Ankara airport. Boarding started 50 minutes before flight due to go which seemed early. Flight was supposed to be 45 minutes, revised to 52, and eventually took 80 as we went past Istanbul and then turned back. This left us with tight connection at AtatÃ¼rk. However we left half an hour late for no apparent reason. So overall too much time on the planes for such a short journey. Onboard service excellent though. In flight entertainment not turned on for first flight, but was for second.",Passive
"We first went to Istanbul in a 4hr flight from Malaga. We had lunch, which was good. Then a Boeing 777 to Tokyo, they took care of the ambience so we didn't have so much jet lag, food came twice, and drinks were served several times. I recommend the home-made lemonade. When going to Tokyo we also enjoyed a typical Turkish cake in the two flights, but when coming back to Malaga we didn't. When coming back to Instanbul, we were next to the catering area, where dishes were prepared. The cabin crew made some noise, so sleeping was a harder thing. I guess the best thing about the food in general is the variety of small things you have when you eat, and the worst thing is the fact that Turkish really don't make a difference between breakfast and lunch/dinner. For example, when going from Narita to Istanbul we had food twice, but before landing at 4 am, I guess it's better to have some small breakfast rather than dinner, remembering we had dinner-like food before on that flight. I really missed the Turkish pistachios when returning. The last thing to mention was the last cabin crew group, when going from Istanbul to Malaga, looked old, like the parents of those who took us to Istanbul in the 777. I would have liked to be able to buy some Turkish Airlines merchandising on-board. Overall, we have to remember the good prices. Turkish will continue being a good airline whenever they continue with that more or less good relation between quality and money.",Promoter

They offered a flight from Rome, but later learnt that it was full. We turned back to Florence. Two days later we went to Pisa Airport -very small - We checked in normally.

I have flown with Turkish Air on previous occasions and found them very good. However this experience was well below their usual good record. Firstly I have to comment on the Turkish Airlines business lounge at Istanbul which would have to be the best lounge anywhere. But unfortunately it's a rose amongst the thorns as the rest of this airport is just awful and unfriendly. Our problems started at boarding where there was no priority whatsoever - in fact we were the last to board. Then the seats in the Boeing 737 are the same as you would expect on a 1 hour flight - very difficult to sleep sitting up. And the chef was missing which is a point of difference for this airline. This was an 11 hour overnight flight so they really need to upgrade the business product. We mysteriously had a 1 hour stopover at some Russian airport on the way that I was not expecting and was not able to use the business lounge there (small as it was). Lastly out bags came out without any priority. So I was really wondering why I paid 3 times the economy ticket price. I have previously been a strong supporter of Turkish Airlines but they let me down badly on this route. I would still recommend them if the plane has lay flat seats in business.,Passive
"I had travelled on 16th July from Munich to Dubai via Istanbul with my family. Our flight from Munich was delayed over an hour. Turkish Airlines staff didn't make much effort to hurry up the process. After landing at Istanbul, we ran across from one side of the airport to the other side in an effort to catch our connecting flight to Dubai. But by the time we reached the gate about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure the gate was closed and none of airline staff could be seen though they should have known that flights from Munich was delayed. There was absolutely no effort to accomodate the extra few minutes for delay in connecting flights. Next when we contacted Turkish Airlines staff about our next connecting flights, one staff member took our boarding passes for Dubai and disappeared for an hour leaving us at the desk. We tried to find out about our next flight status and other staff members were unwilling to answer us leaving us totally bewildered. Finally after waiting over an hour, our new boarding passes were issued. Finally when we landed at Dubai, our baggage were misplaced though we had specifically asked our baggage so to be transferred to new flight. Finally we heard that the baggage was never transferred to the new flights. Today we heard that our baggage had finally arrived at the airport and we were still waiting for our bags.",Detractor
"I am a wheelchair user and traveled alone this time. Turkish Airlines staff made a problem why I travel alone, remarking ""I am not supposed to travel alone"", ask me to sign a document which says they are not responsible for any damage or injury if I would enter the plane. No other passenger was asked to sign this document. Also, after disconnecting the joystick of my power wheelchair, they did not allowed me to take the joystick with me, but put it in a plastic bag and wanted to leave it like that in the cargo part. After I disagreed, because it can be easily damaged, Turkish Airlines staff said to me that the company would rather pay for the joystick than something to happen to the plane because of the joystick. The joystick itself, when disconnected from the batteries has no any power, our laptops and phones can make more problem than disconnected joystick. I have been traveling with Turkish Airlines for couple of times and what always happens is that I am informed as a wheelchair user that I am not able to use the toilet during the flight, because Turkish Airlines does not have cabin chair during the flight, nor they would assist to push the chair to the toilet (which is service other companies offer). The longest flight with Turkish Airlines, in which I was not able to use the toilet was flying from Istanbul to Cape Town, with two hours stop in Johannesburg, so for 15 hours I was not able to use toilet. For passengers without disability, Turkish Airlines may be a good choice, because of their good connections all around the world, but for me as a wheelchair user is a headache. Because of the legislation, when Turkish Airlines is flying in USA, they do have different policy for people with disabilities because in USA you can not discriminate someone because of disability.",Detractor
"Flew to CDG to SAW with B737-800 TC-JFF (has the old livery). Flight was at 19.15, but at 15.00 I learnt that (via Turkish Airlines smartphone application) the flight was delayed by an hour. I couldn't arrive at the airport until 50 minutes before the flight. Even though the check-in counter closes an hour before the scheduled departure, I was able to hand in my luggage (I'd checked-in online). Pushback was at 21.10, and no explanations were made about the delay. At the beginning of the flight, Turkish delight was served. At dinner, either meatballs or chicken could be selected. I chose the meatballs, and it was delicious, and extremely hot for an airline food. I was able to listen the newest Euro Hits by using the in-flight radio.

Legroom was more than expected for an economy class seat. Food was almost as good as what you'd expect at a restaurant. Hot/cold beverages were served throughout the flight. As a means of in-flight entertainment, there was nothing but in-flight music. Not-so-high quality earphones were distributed at the beginning of the flight, and the system lacked variety. Various films/series were played on the on-board screens, I wish it could be possible to see the location/speed/altitude of the plane.

"In reading through other reviews, I can see that my experience unfortunately is not unique. Customer service is lacking. This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines â€“ starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips â€“ first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasn't a big surprise â€“ despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time â€“ on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul â€“ one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation â€“ and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members â€“ first to a supervisor in the check in area â€“ who said â€œnoâ€ and that was that. At the care Point â€“ the staff couldn't care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate. At the gate, we had the most unprofessional and rude encounter and staff said no. I was left with the impression that, no one cares, no one feels responsible and accountable, there's an acute lack of training and proficiency in the most basic part of customer care. If Turkish Airlines wants to deliver on the brand promise â€“ Europe's Best Airline, they need to embrace a better approach to service â€“ caring goes a long way when you are traveling, a smile, empathy and helpful interactions would have made a world of difference.",Detractor

After delay of about half an hour and while the passengers on this full 737-800 were standing for a long time at the new gate, only one staff was taking care of boarding which took a long time and a lot of agony on behalf of passengers to complete. The aircraft was a â€œnew interiorâ€ Boeing 737-800. Again, only one flight attendant was serving the first 12 or so rows which clearly is more than what they usually suppose to handle.

My elderly parents were booked on a flight from Izmir to Houston via Istanbul and were to meet me in Istanbul for the Istanbul to Houston leg. The airline only gave 45 minutes between the Izmir flight and Istanbul-Houston flight. I assumed this meant that there would be no extra passport checks (since that was all done in Izmir) and that there would be gate attendants to direct the passengers trying to make the connection to the proper gate to expedite the process. That was not the case. The plane from Izmir was stood on the tarmac for 25 minutes so they had far less than 45 minutes to get to the Istanbul to Houston flight, which was already boarding at the time and there was no guidance at all. When I inquired as to whether the flight from Izmir had arrived at the Istanbul-Houston gate and when I explained the situation, the staff ignored me and told me to step out of the way. They told me my parents had 5 minutes to get there and that if they didn't the plane would leave without them. They also stated that there was nothing they would do. They would not announce their names and began to laugh at me and speak about me in Turkish in a mocking way. In short, not only were they were neither helpful nor sympathetic, but they were rude. Other passengers boarding the flight noticed this and expressed their displeasure, this was even echoed by some of the security staff of the airport. My parents finally made it. I wanted to like Turkish Airlines, however my trip made it quite plain that this airline is only a premiere airline for those in Business and First class. It is only a premiere airline if you don't ask any questions and only speak when spoken to. Very disappointing.",Detractor
"Superb Comfort class in Turkish Airline.s We flew NYC - Istanbul and return in the Comfort class of Turkish Airlines. This cabin is classified as a Premium Economy cabin, but it is more than that. Large seats (old Business class style), plenty of space, amenities, alcoholic drinks, excellent food in real plates and above all, smiling and helpful staff. Congrats, Turkish Airlines. Great job. When available I will use this class which is just slightly more expensive than most of the uncomfortable Economy class cabins. Please could you trained our US airlines which has totally fake Premium Economy classes (same seats, same food, paid drinks and many times unpleasant staff).",Promoter
"TK1888 and TK 291 on May 25. Flew Vienna-IST-Rostov, the first leg from Vienna was terrible: crew did not speak any English or German, only Turkish, which was quite irritating. Plane was old and seats were very uncomfortable. The only positive experience was in-flight meal. The crew forgot to serve drinks to some passengers, because they all were focused on an Turkish gentleman who got involved in a conflict with a flight-attendant. Landing in IST was rough. Flight from IST was much better but impression was ruined. Disappointed. Flying back next week not expecting anything.",Detractor

We left 1 hour behind schedule but we had great inflight entertainment so the wait wasn't that bad. Then all the trouble happened. Since it was 2am and I would be in the plane for 11 hours I wanted to sleep For some reason my seat didn't recline. I told the cabin crew they smiled and changed my seat. I then slept. I woke up toward the end of the flight and breakfast wasn't served yet. Even though it was like 10 am.

Flew Colombo-Istanbul via Male to Antalya three weeks ago and got back last Monday. All flights were delayed except for the last leg on return flight from Istanbul to Colombo via Male where I really would have prayed for a delay as my connecting flight got 1.30 hrs delayed from Antalya! Good in-flight service and food etc. Flight delays are so common that you spend an addition of 5-6 hrs on the way than originally scheduled! Plus mad rushing from Domestic to International Terminal in Istanbul with only about 20 minutes for the connecting flight. One of my bags came on the flight. Other came one day.

"Flew into Delhi from IST. Business Class. Flight: TK 716 on 5th June 2015. By Far my worst experience in business class. (Despite having flown United several times). On a 6 Hour Flight: Business Class Passengers get blankets and Pillows from the regional Economy Class cabin. Rude Staff horrible service wouldn't even give hot/cold towels before or after meal. Ordered Asian Vegetarian Meal 1 month in advance got it onboard. Nearly Inedible. My mother returned her food we requested for the other vegetarian options from the menu we are told that there qwew none left. 1 hour later I walk in on the staff eating the remaining Indian Vegetarian food. After touchdown did not even give the standard ""Ladies and Gentleman we have arrived at XXX airport or welcome to XXX Airport or the weather report just went on and on about the seatbelts"". Did not even greet passengers during deplaning. Since I flew on the same Airline from the US I have reasonable backing to conclude that these people do not like to cater to passengers on this route or to people belonging from this destination.

"TK 80 SFO to IST in business class. Best transatlantic business class product out there. Its food and service can give any European carrier's First class a run for their money. So much food and drink. Then there are airlines which don't serve even a meal when travelling First Class on a 5 hour flight because its ""domestic"" (eg United). They kept serving us food for the first 3 hours of the 12 hour flight. Entertainment system: Latest one not even shared publicly on the airline website. Touch screen remote which itself has a large interactive LCD screen/player works independent to the main screen! Movie choices: Amazing! Audio albums: Biggest collection I've seen. Seat is a bit narrow however very comfortable to sleep in. Amenity kits were from Cerruti. Although arrival in Istanbul was disappointing due to delayed baggage delivery. The only unfortunate thing is this is their best product and will probably not be used in Asia ever because Turkish heavily favours US destinations over others. eg. On their Delhi Flight they give out thin blankets in business from regional economy class flights. Hopefully this will change.",Promoter

LHR-SFO (return) via IST. Check-in at LHR was fast en efficient and the PrimeClass lounge was nice with a good food selection. Boarding at LHR was a bit chaotic but we got on board. First leg (LHR-IST) was a A321 with large seats in BC very comfortable for the short trip food was ok and the aircrew were friendly. IFE was an older system with 4 movie running on a loop no great but for a three hour flight it was acceptable. IST airport is very overcrowded and even the BC lounge was packed so I decided to get some sleep at the airport hotel. A little pricey but well worth it. Boarding at IST was without any BC priority boarding and extra document and security check before being bussed to the plane. While airports like the old Doha airport had this down to an art IST seems to have turned this in to organised chaos not a nice experience at all. Second leg was a B777 with a 2-3-2 configuration. I had problems seeing how this would work prior to flying by I saw both a single mum with two children and two parents with a child for whom this setup with 3 seats in the middle worked a charm. Flight crew were nice and service minded but very slow to bring food out and the chefs costume is a terrible gimmick they should drop sooner rather than later as unlike Gulf Airlines where you can discuss the meal with an actual chef and make changes to the menu at Turkish they simply take an order from the menu and that is it. Food was good and plentiful. The seat was ok for sitting and eating or lying down but getting a comfortable position to relax in the middle was very hard and took some fiddling with the limited controls. IFE offered true AVOD with a large selection of films and TV shows as well as live TV. Films were not all the latest and greatest but I think there was something for everyone. Return journey started out better than at LHR with quick and efficient check-in at SFO and boarding done in a controlled and orderly fashion. I had a quick look in the United Club lounge with was nice and quiet but had a very limited selection of food. Plane was again a B777 with a good and attentive flight crew although they seemed a bit more robotic than the previous crews. Food was excellent and plentiful although again it seemed to take quite a while to get it served. Short transit in IST where boarding descended in to a new level of chaos with absolutely no announcements no BC priority boarding and extra document checks. As a seasoned flyer I knew to just get in a queue and get on with it but a rookie flyer would have been lost in the chaos. Not good enough and this needs to be changed fairly sharpish. Again a A321 this time with a refurbished cabin which meant the IFE was true AVOD (the same system as on the B777) and nice new seats. Again a pleasant flight crew that spent forever getting food served. The food was good but we got in to LHR about 20 minutes late because we were 30 minutes late out of IST. Price considered the offering is very good as long as you accept that IST airport is old over capacity and chaotic beyond belief.,Promoter
TK 1994 / 1995 16th - 23rd May 2015. My wife and I recently flew to Istanbul with Turkish Airlines.

Jakarta to Istanbul with a stopover at Singapore Changi. Check in was smooth even though Turkish didn't have a fixed check in counter in CGK. Boarding was fast and smooth. On CGK-SIN flight sandwich was served a good one with a selection of drinks. Then we have to leave the plane and reboard again one hour later at Changi. The SIN- IST leg was great the crew served properly but it lacked eye contact. They were chatting with fellow crew members while they were serving passengers. The catering service was good and the amenity case was a good looking tin pencil case which was a nice touch. The IFE was decent with a broad choice of movies and music. The return trip was in the same quality except a fair 45-60 minutes delay because of congestion at Istanbul Ataturk. My conclusion Turkish is a great choice for a long haul flight.,Promoter

After coffee service and trays cleared crew came around with another drink service. Bright lights finally dimmed after 3am when it was already light outside. Global positioning system not working on this flight at least not displayed. Entertainment systems not working too well only limited number of selection.

The transportation to the hotel in Istanbul due to the flight missed was organized however the hotel was a 40 min ride across the Bosporus arriving at 4am in the morning. Okay the in-flight service was okay but would I fly TK again? Not if I can avoid it because there was no information during all these delays my online feedback afterwards produced only prefabricated and unrelated standard answers and more importantly minor delays can produce quickly a 24 hrs. delay if there is only 1 flight per 24 hrs (true not only from long distance trips!).,Detractor

Flew from JFK to Istanbul with transfer to Bologna 4/23. Flight delayed 1.5 hrs - no big deal happens. Seat cramped personal entertainment system broken. Food and drink better than average - I'll give them that. Istanbul airport is a crowded mess and the info monitors are not very informative. About 30 min before the scheduled boarding time they flash the message that our flight from Istanbul to Bologna was canceled along with > 40 other flights. No overhead announcement no airport workers in sight can explain coherently what to do or don't speak English. We later learn that a plane caught fire on landing and the runway was closed because of that. After about 6 hrs of running from one place to another and dealing with incompetent and rude employees we were fed and placed in a hotel.

The first 3 hours of the flight is an eating delight. There were 2 fully decked out chefs on-board in Business class. The food presentation was just amazing. The food itself was very tasty and it just keep coming. Nothing was too much trouble. The table layout was like dining in a top restaurant and it even had an electronic candle that flickered. Breakfast was an equally excellent experience of service and taste. The seats are very roomy and quite comfortable for that long 11 hour flight and go fully flat. Ok the not so good. And it their lounge in HK. Its not their own lounge and its a shared arrangement. Its very down market and not very well appointed. To have a shower you had to book in and the next available time was 11.45pm 20 min after my flight was to leave.

On our short (3-hour) flight we were served a full meal (they even hand out menu cards beforehand!). That alone impressed me but then when I saw how nicely it was arranged/presented and how good it tasted I was blown away. I don't think I've ever 'cleared my plate' on with any previous airline meal but that happened on both flights (to and from Istanbul).

I flew in Economy from JFK to Ankara via Istanbul on April 24 2015 and returned on May 2. My overall experience was very positive: Turkish provides superb meals on transatlantic flights and even managed a satisfying mini-meal on the short Istanbul-Ankara flight. Cabin staff were abundant friendly and present on all four flights. Ticket counter and gate personnel had a somewhat severe affect but were nonetheless very helpful. Turkish B777's are fairly new (the oldest is less than 5 years old) clean and offer very good inflight entertainment. Lavatories seemed clean throughout the flight. Economy seating is quite cramped on Turkish B777's however but not to the point of discomfort. Ataturk Airport in Istanbul is better approached as an adventure rather than as a convenience: it is prone to delays chaotic lines and overheated spaces.

There was also a printed menu with a choice of entrees. The legroom is a bit tight but the seat has an adjustable lumbar support and a footrest that help in adjusting position.

I will say that customer service/communication is not their strongest point but the service on the flight between SFO and IST was excellent.

"TK 333 Baku to Istanbul. Six hours delayed without any explanation. Once it finally boarded and took off the crew never acknowledged the delay in any way just wished us a nice flight! Toward the end of the flight they announced gates for those who had not missed their connections. Never acknowledged that some of us had gave no instructions whatsoever. When I found a service desk the guy printed out my new boarding pass (for a flight the next morning) and threw it at me only when I asked did he blurt out something about going through passport control then to the hotel desk. By then it was late at night three PP control guys serving a huge crowd people starting to get angry and shout. I was afraid I would get through PP control then not get any help and be stuck outside the airport so instead I headed for the wonderful Turkish Airlines VIP lounge. There they refused to give me one of the sleeping rooms but did offer a ""five star hotel"" and a shuttle if I left the airport. By then it was so late that I would barely have time to get to the hotel before it would be time to return to the airport for my early flight so I hung out in the lounge all night.

Done 4 flight segments in 3 weeks DMM-IST IST-FCO BCN-IST and IST-DMM. Check-in was organized and was swift given because there were not much pax on all flights problem started on the boarding it was chaotic where everyone just ran to board the plane and ground cannot enforce boarding rules like who should go first etc. There wasn't much enforcement of carry on luggage as well as most passengers bring huge bags sometimes 2-3 pieces inside the cabin and some passenger didn't have any space for their luggage to place. Flight was delayed on all flights either due to late arrival of the aircraft or the cabin needs to cleaned before passenger can board or there is no gate assigned yet. which should have been pretty standard in most airlines. Once onboard the service was a hit and miss some cabin crew were rude and with poor command of English and while some maybe 1 or 2 are eager to please cabin is as usual clean but the toilets gets filthy half through the flight. The seats are very narrow and uncomfortable I'm an average 5'8'' in height and was having difficulty moving this onboard their A321 and Boeing 737. IFE was average not much new movies and quite unresponsive the touchscreens you'll still have to use the remote. Information from the cockpit came only twice before take off and before landing.

"We flew LGW-IST-CMB on 16/4 and being a frequent flyer and Star Alliance Gold member I can easily say that this was the worst flying experience of my life. I have never met so rude uninterested and unhelpful staff on any other airline before. To start with I was denied access to a lounge at LGW. I am aware that Star Alliance do not have a lounge there but all other airlines I have used before have given me access to contracted lounges. TK did not. First flight as relatively OK on their new B737 but seats were very uncomfortable. Then we arrived in IST and the problems started. When I went to the lounge and connected my phone to the wifi I found an email from them saying ""your flight to {1} is delayed please contact {2}"". I went to the lounge reception and showed them the email and they told me it's nothing to worry about. When I looked on their website though I saw that the IST-CMB flight was delayed by 5 hours. From then it took us about 3 hours in order to sort out a hotel. When the flight departed the next morning there was no mention at all by anyone as to why the flight was delayed or a single apology. 10 hours on that plane and nothing.

"Flew to London Heathrow from Hurghada via Istanbul. Everything started off fine. Punctual and a comfortable business class seat on what appeared to be a brand new 737-800. The problems then began with the plane landing in the ""wrong"" Istanbul airport. One very brief announcement from the Captain about weather and that is where the information stopped. No one on board was able to give us any information about missed connecting flights whilst we waited on the tarmac. Plane was full of connecting passengers. Plane then takes off to the correct airport. On arrival there was nobody from Turkish Airlines to process or inform customers of what to do. Eventually we found the transfer desk which had a minimum of 250 people descending on only 4 very harassed and extremely impolite ticket agents. When I finally got to the front the ticket desk agent simply stood up and walked away announcing that it was the end of his shift. Got a new pass for a plane leaving 5 hours later. Still no apology. Just thrown at me as if I should be grateful. Found the business class lounge that was also stuffed to the gunnels at the entry reception and barely a seat available in the place. Summoned to the new gate at far end of the airport. It was a full Airbus 330-300. There was a double security check leading to a seated area that was the size for a small commuter jet flight. 280 or so Passengers were rammed into each other waiting for the coach. There was no Business class fast track. On board staff were the most unfriendly bunch and seemed to have a collapse in their understanding of basic English. One seemed to really struggle with the concept of ""Could I have my lunch a bit later?"" Suffice to say my meal was served with no menu. I was then told that it was either Chicken or Pasta. They forgot to offer me the dessert and I had to chase them for it and was told ""We will see if we have anything left."" Even on disembarkation at the plane of the door they pointedly refused to say goodbye. The main hub is a complete mess and deeply unpleasant experience and the staff on board are feckless and rude. I would put this Business class experience down as the worst premium flight of my life. I fly on average 100 times per year nearly always in premium cabins. so that is saying something. Only saving grace were the seats themselves. Which have to be said on both flights were comfortable.",Detractor

They gave us all sorts of things like toothbrushes blindfolds and slippers etc for maximum comfort and gave the kids a Rubiks Cube and a blow up Turkish Airlines plane. Flight attendants were friendly some weren't. Entertainment was good a wide range of movies and music. Seats were comfortable with recline. There was a lot of legroom on the second flight. I look forward to flying on Turkish Airlines on my return trip.,Promoter
Flew Economy Class from Athens to Istanbul with a Brand new Boeing 777-300. Seat was very comfortable Cabin Crew also very friendly but ignored me when I pressed the button to call them. Food was very good for Short-Haul flights. The InFlight Entertainment was very organized and I had a huge selection of Movies and Music. Although the screen once in a while would turn off and wouldn't turn back on. There was no turbulence during the flight. I would fly Turkish Airlines again.,Promoter
I flew Beirut - Istanbul ground check in was ok but a little bit crowded. Food was probably the best food you can eat in an airplane. Staff were friendly but not too friendly the seats were comfortable and entertainment was nice although I would recommend less out-dated music. I found a piece of chewed chewing gum stuck on the seat in front of me which proves no professional cleaning was done. Second staff barely speak English or any other language other than Turkish but they remain friendly although it wouldn't hurt to smile more would it? Last but not least Istanbul airport is a no-go it's dirty extremely crowded and has no free wifi!,Passive
TK1843 IST-ATH ticket bought with Aegean. 738 downgraded from 77W very comfortable old leather seats. Catering top-notch the best I have had on a short-haul flight and comparable only with Qatar. FA's proactive and kind a stark contrast with Aegean that followed. Ground staff is deplorable however check-in agents unable to speak proper English. Also Istanbul airport is a disaster: crowded dirty and without free Wi-Fi. A hit and miss experience that decreases once we take into account everything other than the flight itself.,Passive
Recently flew from London to Osaka and Hong Kong to London via Istanbul. Some of the flight attendants were friendly some could make a bit more effort. Food was better than expected. Inflight entertainment was good with recent films were already available. Only a few mins delayed in arriving for all four legs of my flights. Only had about one hour to connect from HK to Gatwick at Istanbul the plane arrived 20-25mins late so it was a bit of a rush and I almost missed my flight. Overall having read online reviews I had very low expectation but the inflight service turned out to be a lot better than other carriers I've flown with.,Passive
PRG-IST and IST-PRG. My first flight with Turkish Airlines and quite a disappointment. We were about one hour late on both flights - as the air conditioning was not on it was awfully hot on the plane but no water was offered. The seats were not very comfortable and there was very little space. The flight attendants did not seem very interested in what people were doing (like playing with their mobiles and reclining the backs of their seats during the take-off). On the return flight there was a family with an infant squealing like an air raid siren sitting two rows away from me which turned the whole flight into a torture exercise. To finish on a positive note - food was very good and I appreciated having my own screen with flight information. Yet in future I will try to avoid Turkish Airlines and it is a mystery for me how they can score so well in the ratings.,Detractor
OSL-IST-AGP return February/March 2015. OSL-IST on B738 aircraft. Flight more than 80% full. Cramped seating in economy. I moved to a row of 3 vacant seats were I could sleep after the meal service. The same applies for the AGP-IST sector on B738 aircraft. IST-AGP on A321-200. The aircraft seemed brand new. The flight was almost 100% full. My seat was in an emergency exit row and so the legroom was very good. The same applies for the IST-OSL sector A321-200 aircraft and seated in an emergency exit row. I had the option to travel for a slightly lower fare non-stop with Norwegian (from Gardermoen airport) or Ryanair (from another Oslo airport not Gardermoen) but I had to be at Malaga at a determined time of the day and when you factor in the luggage Turkish Airlines was then the most reasonable option. In addition the friendly and efficient staff the service standards catering in-flight entertainment and onboard comfort on Turkish Airlines (apart from seat pitch) were top notch. The duty free shopping and dining opportunities at IST airport were an added plus. I definitely recommend Turkish Airlines.,Promoter
TK 1956 AMS-IST old aircraft and the so called Business Class an outdated most uncomfortable 'joke' with zero comfort. TK 0673 IST-MBA the 757 single aisle aircraft is not suitable for long haul flights and the C-Class seats compared to other airlines like KQ or KL which I frequently use on this route of poor standard and lacking comfort. Service run of the mill food mediocre and run out of choice with selection of 25ml bottled wine - very poor.,Detractor
LHR-IST return. As a frequent business class passenger who has already tried British Airways Lufthansa KLM Etihad Emirates I can only say that this was definitely the worst of them all. Old and run-down seats with parts of the seat torn down and dirty. First part of the trip with newer 777 and angled lie flat but return a recliner like on a premium economy. Serving of the food and the quality more like an economy class and nothing like a business class. Flight attendants OK except one lady on the return who was rude.,Detractor
From ORD-IST and back in economy. Row 16 and 22 respectively. Our first experience with Turkish. We requested vegetarian meals and a gluten free meal for my sister we all had excellent food and even had fresh squeezed orange juice (at least on the IST-ORD leg). The seats were comfortable too with a recline and a second option to slide the seat bottom outward giving more of a natural reclined feeling allowing better sleep without cramping the person behind you! Hot towels before the meal (I still love these simple things) and Turkish delight before service. The entertainment selection was good movies could have had a better selection but the music was fantastic. From the overall comfort and food quality I was able to sleep for 5 hours on a 9.5 hour night trip. I never sleep that much in economy! I believe their aircraft's sacrifice a few of the bathrooms for food/beverage/storage. It seems the bathrooms get used a bit more though there are never lines. The flight crew kept the bathrooms cleaned several times during the journeys. I would definitely fly them again mainly from the food and comfort perspective. When you put that in comparison to the price it works out pretty well.,Promoter
From Houston TX to Vienna AT via Istanbul and return. I had only 1 hour for the transfer in Istanbul was told that's not enough time to catch the connection flight. That's plenty of time as you just walk a short distance to the other gate. No traveling to the other terminal needed. The flights were very pleasant by the quality of food (salmon shrimps even in economy) comfort and flight attendant service on these flights. Porcelain plates variety choice of food proper cutlery and napkins hot towels. Turkish delight at the beginning of the flight. nice menu cart plenty of drinks and sandwich any time you ask for during the flight. Just the whiskey is not the small bottle was given the glass. Staff very attentive and even transit at Istanbul was hassle-free. The ticket was like U$ 350 cheaper compare to others airlines flying to Vienna!,Promoter

Porcelain plates choice of food proper cutlery and napkins hot towels no stinting on drinks and water. Staff very attentive and even transit at Istanbul was hassle-free.

Guangzhou-Istanbul-Venice. Guangzhou-Istanbul: Comfort class (Premium Economy). Managed 6 hours of good sleep which is more than OK for me. As usual the seat is extremely comfortable.

The Istanbul-Venice flight was just a regular uneventful European flight.,Promoter
I fly Turkish to IST from several locations in Europe in economy. The airplanes tend to be a bit older and the crew tends to be pretty much the same as most airlines have in economy. Catering pluses are the fresh orange juice and warm meal which most other airlines now forgo can't speak about the inflight entertainment because I never use it. However there is one huge negative - the online checking is a mess giving PNR or e-ticket number works maybe 10% of the time and I'm forced to go to the airport early and queue to get a boarding pass even though I don't have any luggage. This is the only Star Alliance airline where this happens to me I've checked with colleagues and they all have the same problem especially on code-share tickets. I've now started to avoid Turkish flights just for this reason as I need to waste about an hour in their huge and chaotic queues at Istanbul which also destroys any potential trip satisfaction.,Detractor
GOT-IST-DAC-IST-GOT on A320 A330-200 back on A330-200 and B738 in Jan/Feb 2015. Mixed review to say the least. Flight delayed from GOT due to bad weather in IST. Middle seat turned down but otherwise standard economy seat and no IFE. Food ok. Arrived late and got a hotel night free of charge at IST since the flight to DAC was next day. Lounge at IST is wonderful and I really felt relaxed before boarding tk 713 to DAC. Old plane poor IFE poor service. The lights in the cabin were blinking all the flight and I was worried someone would get an epilepsy attack. no lie flat seat felt like a plane from the mid-90's. All in all not a pleasant business class experience. Flight back tk 714 on leased 330-200 this time a newer plane good service lie flat also a leased plane from jet airways. Plane on time and standard business trip. Once again short visit at the IST lounge which was good and flight from IST-GOT on good intra-europe business class with wide seats good service since we were only two passengers in the front.,Detractor

TK8 IAD-IST. Seat 5K business class. Never again. I have been flying Qatar Airways a lot lately - no comparison. Late departure from IAD. Business cabin felt crowded with narrow aisles. Service rushed. Galleys were noisy with no attempt by the crew to be at all quiet. Seat not good with confusing controls (what does MR and M+ mean in the armrest controls?). Armrests and tray table were unmovable. So what if there's a crew member wearing a chefs hat. The food was dreadful. Dried out. Overcooked. Tasteless. Terrible seats. Economy and business class passengers all mixed up with no clear delineation between the two cabins. The lavatories are so small that I banged my elbows in the most minimal effort to change clothes. Waste bins full before we'd even pushed back from Dulles and soap dispensers nearly empty. Unreal. Felt like Aeroflot in 1970. Appetizers dried out. I asked the flight attendant what kind of soup they were serving and she didn't know. So much for pre-departure briefings for the crew. Honestly a poor show for an airline that prides itself on its food. AVOD confusing and boring. Could never find the map. The crew spent most of its time standing at the â€˜bar' looking at all of us like we were monkeys in a cage. Really unbelievable. The soccer stars who are advertising for TK are all flying on private aircraft - make no mistake. If they ever took TK they soon switch to Singapore Airlines or Cathay Pacific first class. FAs walking around with their airport IDs badges hanging from their necks - what is that all about? Really disappointed with TK. For all the hype in their advertising a big letdown. Couldn't get off fast enough. Now have to endure another seven hours to DAR.,Detractor
Frankly a disappointment. I flew Turkish Airlines Business Class recently: Lisbon-Istanbul Istanbul-Seoul Bangkok-Istanbul and Istanbul-Lisbon and it was the least satisfactory business class in recent years. In all flights except the Istanbul-Seoul the cabin and seats appeared run-down and old. The in-flight entertainment was limited and out-dated. The seats comfort was OK but not more than that. The service was friendly and the food was OK.,Passive
"Flew from Paris to Samsum via Istambul and return in Economy. From reading previous reviews on this site and others it seems TA passengers can be separated in 2 categories: Everything went as scheduled and the performance is highly rated or something goes wrong and TA customer service is at best non-existent. Luckily I was in the 1st category. In CDG TA is in the old terminal 1 (not their fault!) which is completely outdated. Departure was a little delayed due to late arrival but we recovered most of it during the flight. Very recent A321 with IFE (choice not outstanding but OK for a 3.5 hours flight). The crew spoke good English (1 stewardess spoke French) the seat pitch is comfortable (at least 10 cms / 4 "" more than AF) the food is fair both in quantity and in quality with a hot meal and a choice of drinks including wine and alcohol. A much better service than their French competitor with bus-type cabin and no IFE. The domestic flight was done on a slightly older A320 with even better seat pitch and here again crew spoke English and served some sandwich and drink. Return was of a similar standard fresh Turkish breakfast in the domestic flight good service and acceptable meal in the international flight. Istanbul airport is not at the same level but it's an other story. Safety demonstrations done in all 4 flights general condition of the aircraft's from good to excellent. Regarding this trip I believe TA is in the top league of European airlines.",Promoter

I was traveling from Washington D.C USA to Vienna Austria yesterday with a layover in Istanbul. It was a long flight however throughout the both flights I was completely satisfied with the staff service and the quality of food likewise.

I flew Comfort Class from IST to JFK. I've always been impressed with the service on economy class Turkish Airlines so I spent the upgrade for Comfort. I'd compare the legroom and quality of service to domestic American Airlines Business Class. It's nearly business class levels of comfort for about 20% more than economy would've cost me. The food was excellent I appreciate being given choices for my meals and drinks as well as having porcelain dishware. The entertainment selection is one of the best I've had on an airline.

Understanding their English is a problem even the announcements by pilot were difficult to understand. The ground staff in Istanbul need to learn customer service.

I have flown with Turkish Airlines three times in the past year. Once from Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh Return (suppose it qualifies as a flight) once from Bangkok to Tel Aviv via Istanbul Return and once from Bangkok to Tashkent via Istanbul Return. All flights were way above average - and I know what I am talking about because in the past 12 months I have flown on TG QF VN SQ NZ and PX on more than 50 return flights. I actually hate flying but have to fly to my place of assignment but flying Turkish Airlines is very good. Most cabin staff - male or female - are very good to excellent (several among the best I have ever dealt with) the food is very good IFE way above average and aircraft in very good condition (staff make sure toilets are always kept clean and are up there TG QF CX and NZ). My only real grip is rush rush at transit - Istanbul Airport not the best in the world although Turkish Airlines Lounge must be one of the best - and one of the A321 I flew on from Istanbul to Tashkent had several rows of non-reclining seats (mine 9C) so I must read Seat Guru more carefully in future.,Promoter

BKK-IST-ARN on A330 and then A321. Flight from BKK late 1h arrived in IST in the midst of the snow chaos. Landed 2h late then stuck on tarmac for 1h. No gate so exit in severe snowfall and winds people in flip flops and t- shirts as this was from Thailand. Shipped on buses finally to terminal in utter chaos as all flights were cancelled. Thousands of people and only 3 TK representatives to help. Took into hotel at own cost rebooked tickets next morning via phone. Then headed for airport again flights cancelled again and no help anywhere and of course thousands of angry passengers stranded. TK head office is a place of shame that gave absolutely no help actually the sour lady just said no and then called for next in line. Result 2 days in IST from own pocket. Flying business and being star alliance gold gives little in this company when it matters. Even refused to be rebooked on other flights. Needless to say last flight IST-ARN was 1h late boarding commenced without communication between gate and crew so business passengers and others too stood 20 min outside of plane door watching crew clean the cabin and stock the food. Quite embarrassing. Was planning another flight with TK in business to BKK but my money goes from now to other carriers.,Detractor
The check-in and departure time are always chaotic with Turkish Airlines. I flew already 8 times with Turkish and they are usually late. Connections at Istanbul are tight which is not matching with the systematic delays of Turkish Airways. If you miss your plane the hotel is provided by Turkish Airlines but the transfer to the hotel is terrible without mentioning the terrible and unprofessional attitude from the visas service + immigration + info desks at Istanbul Airport. Globally I would not recommend Turkish Airways. Even if I omit the delay issues and even if the service on board is OK there is still this something missing that does not make me want to fly again with Turkish Airways - maybe courtesy from their staff. The only point I am impressed about is that even if Istanbul Airport seems to be an organizational chaos the luggage is usually arriving at the final destination even when the time between connection flights are tight (of course if the planes are on time).,Detractor
Flew TK 1332 BRE-IST then TK 716 IST-DEL round-trip. I booked the flight quite spontaneously and TK was surprisingly cheap. Having read that TK is quite good I was a little bit disappointed. Though the food was really great (the Turkish delight is delicious and I like the idea of the fresh orange juice) and I was even given a second menu the staff disappointed me. Perhaps it was only me but I didn't feel very welcome their English wasn't always understandable. Furthermore my flight from Bremen to Istanbul was delayed by over an hour and thus getting my connection was definitely exhausting. When the plane arrived at the gate my last call had already begun. Unfortunately there was no help offered by the FAs. All in all I chose not to recommend Turkish because the onboard product is just average and I prefer airlines being held by more democratic states than Turkey.

"Flew from DXB-IST-JFK in December 2014 and the return JFK-IST-DXB in January 2015. At check-in in DXB I requested an emergency exit seat for the IST-JFK leg. The rookie check-in agent first said nothing was available but his supervisor stopped by and found one for me. This made the long flight bearable. The flight was packed but the crew were cheerful and efficient and did everything right. Food was so-so - getting a bit weary of the standard kebabs and mystery veggies. The IFE was excellent - far better than Emirates' much touted IFE and better than QR. On the way back was checked in by a surly female agent at JFK. She couldn't find me an exit row on the A-330 to IST but said she found me a bulkhead one on the IST-DXB leg. The A330 was surprisingly comfortable much more so that the 777 even for my 6'3"" frame and the young lady next to me just curled up and slept the whole way through and was no bother to me. On the home leg I found that the seat the JFK agent had got me a seat in the row behind the bulkhead! On the 777 with the seats compressed for the 'short-haul' 4 hour flight to DXB I found sitting was unbearable. I silently cursed this agent and couldn't wait to deplane and get home. Service was once again good and the scrambled eggs were fluffy and tasty. But any satisfaction I got from this was neutralized by the uncomfortable seat and the incompetence of the check-in agent at JFK. This is the second time this has happened to me. A year ago flying from AGP-IST-DOH the agent at AGP assured me she had got me an exit row and I found myself directly behind exit row in a non-reclining seat. TK has to train its check-in staff to read the seat map better. Am contemplating a trip very soon to AGP and then later to BOS and wondering whether to fly TK after these twin disasters.",Passive
Turkish Airlines deserves to be the #1 European airlines! It treats people in the economy class like other airlines treat business class passengers.

JFK-IST-DHA and return in Jan 15. Be advised that planes have no individual ventilation system and were unexpectedly quite warm on all segments. The planes on all segments were dirty. Leaving Istanbul in both directions the restroom had not been wiped down or restocked. There was trash in the seat pocket and in one instance on my seat! There was a marked difference in staff treatment of passengers. On US legs the staff were merely uninterested. On the Dhaka leg the flight attendants were actively rude. Though there was no noticeable turbulence on the Dhaka bound leg we were instructed to remain seated and not permitted to go the restroom for 5 hours. The lady in the seat in front of me called the attendant. Three times the attendant came by and switched off the light and left without asking the reason for the call. The fourth time the lady put out her hand and asked for a glass of water. The attendant rolled her eyes and half an hour later brought a half glass. Also delayed takeoff at Dhaka (which seems to be a hallmark of TA judging from these reviews) caused all passengers on the full flight to miss their connections for the night. The only announcement in the cabin at landing at 6pm was to list the connecting gates. But there were no flights until the next day. There was no assistance with arrangements. The lucky people who knew what to do and had money for a visa waited 3-4 hours outside the airport for a TA transfer to a hotel. Those without experience or funds wandered the airport all night looking for a helpful TA rep to no avail. Never again. I will pay the extra for Emirates.,Detractor

The gate isn't announced until just 1 hour before departure and until then there is hardly any seating whatever there is it is for patrons of the overpriced restaurants. At the gate there was no boarding plan and no announcements! Just a hoard of passengers moving towards the gate in any random order. The most intriguing factor is their double standard- flights to/from the US serve Turkish Delights and hot towels have friendly staff who speak good English. On flights to India they don't serve any welcome sweet or hot towels and the staff are rude and can barely muster up basic English. On the return trip this double standard was confirmed. Also the flights to the US connect the airport with jetways where as Indian flights have to use a bus! Flights to the US require extra screening which again is done in a totally disorganized fashion and what's more our gate changed after the screening so we had to repeat the screening at the new gate! They ask weird questions going into much more detail than US immigration ever would and make you grossly uncomfortable. Our flight was delayed almost 2 hrs out of IST due to this gate change fiasco.,Passive
Flight 15 Istanbul-Sao Paulo/Buenos Aires as usual operated with Boeing 777-300ER. Flew Comfort/Premium Economy class. This was the best long-haul flight I have taken. What impressed me on this flight was the cabin crew: they were smiling polite and always there. I felt sick (heavy headache) and two members regularly came to me (flight time was 13.30 hours due to bad weather conditions on the Atlantic) to check if I was feeling better or not. Food by Turkish Do&Co was as always delicious. Price paid was super. I do look forward to my next TK flight which will be in six days.,Promoter
I flew Economy from Istanbul to Lahore. My flight was delayed in Istanbul by 6.5 hours but no one informed us until twenty minutes after the flight was supposed to depart. Even then we had to look at the screens to tell us. Never did an airport representative bother telling us what was happening. We spent two hours walking around the airport like sheep trying to find a single dinner voucher due to the airport staffs incompetence and indifference. Every single staff member in the airport was rude and disrespectful. The one dinner we were offered was a chicken dish that tasted like plastic and was quickly discarded by all of the passengers. Will never fly with Turkish again nor through Istanbul ever again.,Detractor
STR-IST-DOH TK 1706 A320 (TC-JUK). STR-IST was not as pleasant as previous TK flights: did TK reduce the seat pitch? No more height adjustable head rest no IFE not even overhead screens. Service food flying were TK standard (which is pretty good) but the narrow seat pitch will have me looking for alternatives if this should become normal. Onward flight to Doha on A321 was normal standard nice seats in seat IFE - that's TK I like.,Passive
I flew business class from Istanbul to Los Angeles my seat was 1D. This was flight TK 9. The flight was January 16 2015. It was wonderful service the best I have ever had. The food was good and served in a nice preparation. The Chef is outfitted in a nice chef outfit and gives you the impression you are in a restaurant. The menu choices were broad and adequate. We had a nice trolley of appetizers salads main dish then the deserts. Good quality and plenty of choices. I like when they offer to make up your bed. The flight attendants are attentive and are always picking up after the passengers. The movie selections were good. Always nice to have free Wi-FI. Turkish airlines have way more comfortable seats than some o the other carriers like British Airlines. I will fly them again.,Promoter
Flew A321 Business class IST-LHR. Seating was economy seating that was very hard. The food and service in the cabin was excellent but was let down by the physical cabin environment. Turkish Airlines should really think hard about assigning these aircraft on flights of 4 hours. The seats are not business class and are quite uncomfortable. For the duration of the flight I sat on the pillow. Additionally there was no inflight entertainment. Turkish Airlines can do better than this. I will think carefully before choosing Business Class again on this airline if this type of aircraft is assigned.,Detractor
Flew LHR-IST on 737-800 Business Class. Inflight Entertainment was OK. Seat comfort was not great and the recline angle very small on this aircraft. For a business class seat it hardly reclines to a comfortable angle for resting. I think Turkish Airlines need to reconsider their business class product on medium hall routes as their long haul business class is excellent. This was rather unsatisfactory.,Detractor

Travelled return trip from Montreal to Tehran with family. Had $600 deal which was great. Impressed with the number of hand outs. They hand out a bag full of slippers eye and ear covers toothbrush. They take care of kids very well too. Montreal to Istanbul flight was a newer plane. They are also not picky about a kilo or two overweight which is great. Per pay lounge in Istanbul is free for kids. For $21 you and your children can spend 6 hrs in an all you can eat snack lounge take a shower and recharge. The negatives were: They put me my wife and 3 yr old and 6 yr old daughters in completely separate seats in different rows for the 2nd leg. Istanbul airport is simply not large enough or updated enough to transit the volume of passenger its doing. I found the airport staff rude and unhelpful on a couple of occasions. I would still fly Turkish for flights that aren't via Istanbul.,Passive
We found it unacceptable being placed in a side room being used to re- charge batteries for electric vehicles! A large group of disabled passengers were left in this dreadful room. Only seating was non upholstered dropdown metal seats with a narrow gap between them. There was inadequate space to pass resulting in feet being stood on and legs being banged every time someone needed to pass. When we arrived in Manchester staff had forgotten to request wheelchairs. In all made to feel like third class citizens. Don't accept disabled passengers if you don't want to look after them. There was very little help for us on this airline.,Passive

Flew JFK-MAN in late December after reading recent reviews I was very hesitant about choosing Turkish. They were the cheapest legacy airlines on this route besides the slight detour to Turkey I thought no problem. Being star gold check in at JFK was easy with no waiting was informed at check in that flight was delayed by an hour due to late arrival of previous flight. I had a 2 hour connection in Istanbul asked the check in lady whether it'll be a problem she said no problem plenty of time. Went into Lufthansa lounge as it was the better option of lounges very good quality food/drinks and very quiet. Only problem was no monitors for boarding I proceeded to boarding gate at the time on the boarding pass and there was a was slight delay. Ended boarded first aircraft was clean and in good condition A330-300. Sat in the first section of economy in window finally departed 2hours late due to traffic at JFK knew I'd be pretty lucky to make my next flight. In-flight service was great food good quality and plenty of drinks frequently. Only part I could fault was the size of the offerings was on the small side besides that FA where attentive and helped passengers in every way. I found the onboard chef a bit of a laugh with his hat and outfit but it is a good look and it's a unique product in the industry. I asked one flight attendant what was to happen with my connection when I arrived - no help just said plenty of flights to MAN daily. Arrival into IST was when my next flight was boarding I thought I might have a slight chance if gates were close arrived to a remote stand and we were bussed in. No one was there to help connecting passengers everyone had no idea where to go I eventually found the transfer desk. Was put on a flight 5 hours later no food vouchers offered or compensation or an apology. I used the 'amazing lounge' which would be great with about 50% less people the lounge was packed it was struggle to find a table or chairs. I tired to get some sleep somewhere but was unable to. Asked to use shower but there was a 4 hour wait I said ok because I had five hours got given a buzzer and waited. Finally boarded MAN flight A320 it was uneventful good in-flight entertainment staff were good but less happy than previous leg. Turkish Airlines in-flight product is very good but they really need to work on ground staff and transfers at IST after that flight I said never again purely because of the transfer.,Passive
Flights 33 and 34 round-trip from Houston to Istanbul from July 26th 2014 through August 10th 2014. They have the best food and inflight entertainment. Their Boeing 777 Cabin is new and looks very nice. They make my flight a real pleasure every time I fly with them.,Promoter

"IST-Paris CDG Business Class A330-200. Boarding at extremely crowded and too small IST Airport was a mess. Surprisingly for wide-body airplane boarding was via buses in pouring rain and it took ages to close the doors which caused almost 50 mins delay. No explanation given. Service not too consistent. Amazing ""little touches"" like welcome drinks of different selection of juices pieces of Turkish delights food was fantastic and it was the best part of the flight. However plane was quite old and dirty cabin crew well groomed but quite robotic IFE ok but no Air Show with a map included (which I found very strange or I couldn't find it for 4 hours). Altogether Turkish exceeds in catering for sure but other than that it is just a regular airline. Flown better.",Passive
OSL-IST-MLA return. A widebody A330-200 aircraft operated OSL-IST sector. Excellent IFE (though no moving map channel or display). The dinner service was almost perfect. Very comfortable seat. Shame that eye contact by the cabin crew was almost inexistent and service delivered in a very robotic manner. Flight arrived at IST with a 1-hour delay. All in all a great flight. IST-MLA on a A320 aircraft in Y/C was very good especially the catering (freshly-squeezed orange juice and lemonade in economy together with turkish delight at the start of the service - very nice indeed). The crew on this flight was very friendly. In-seat audio IFE and moving map display in small overhead screens. Great flight. MLA-IST in Y/C on A320 aircraft. Good service and very good catering again. In-seat audio IFE not working (even though I tried 3 different seats. There was a moving map display in small overhead screens). The flight landed at IST almost 1hr 15 minutes late. Overall a very good flight. IST-OSL in Y/C on A330 widebody aircraft. Excellent IFE. Very good service friendly crew and good catering. A very good flight overall. I'll definitely consider flying TK again. TK must improve customer service culture among its staff (eye contact smiles and do away with robotic service). This is why I would rather fly Lufthansa on this route unless TK has more competitive fares.,Promoter
Pre - and post - flight experience was terrible! Delayed flight by several hours due to bad weather no one can give you information on your long-haul connecting flight that I missed and no business class service! Thankfully they make up for it onboard. Even though it's a narrow-body you have a chef onboard and the food is totally outstanding. You (nearly) forget about all the problems you've had until then! The 3.5 hour flight on an older A321-200 has a 3-3 business class configuration where the middle seat is made into a table. Comfortable. But it's the service and food that made the Turkish flight superb.,Passive
I'm amazed that a 737-800 can fly 6 hours and 20 minutes which is how long this flight from Istanbul to Nairobi was. Who knew! This is a brand new 737 with a 2-2 business class configuration. Not flat beds though just recliner business class seats. Which for such a long flight is a bit of an inconvenience especially given the tix price. Love having the cook on board. From Turkish delight which is served to you at the very beginning of the flight to your meals ending with strong Turkish coffee the culinary experience is outstanding. Service was a bit distracted. They forgot the menu. They forgot the toiletry bag. The lights were never really dimmed off on this overnight flight. But ok it happens some times. This is a great plane for continental flights but am not convinced it works for 6+ hour overnight flights. You're pretty much sleeping upright which is not what you're looking for on such a long flight.,Passive
After our trip just before Christmas from Ercan-Munich 12/12/14 Ercan-Heathrow 18/12/14 and Heathrow-Ercan 23/12/14. I can positively state that we will not be flying with them again if we can find an alternative. The flights were late both directions and the Heathrow-Ercan flight was so late we missed the connection and consequently spent 6hrs plus at Attaturk this is most unsatisfactory from an airline which is supposed to be one of the best.,Detractor
I flew Turkish Air from Los Angeles to Istanbul in comfort class row 11 aisle seat. It had no seats in front of me. This area is very roomy. Comparing to BA's seat room this is great.

This airline just seemed roomier. Good movie selection. I like the snacks and hot cloths.,Promoter
We flew a family of 6 CGK-TLV and TLV-AMS all via IST. First time flying and we were satisfied. Plane departed late from Jakarta but made up in the air and arrived in Istanbul 5min behind schedule and we were on time for our connecting flight to Tel Aviv. It was on a A330 seats felt wider than any other airlines IFE was good food definitely better than average airline food and service from the cabin crew was friendly. The plane made a stop in Singapore. IST-TLV-IST on a smaller 319 without IFE service is ok. IST-AMS on a old very small B737 here the seats felt cramped. Overall TK is a good airline for the price we paid we will definitely use them again.,Passive
IST-BKK a flight we were looking forward to but which disappointed. Our domestic connection was very late but we were given no help at all at Ataturk to transfer to the international terminal in fact an airport staff member tried to prevent us taking the fast route through. The Bangkok flight was listed as only 10 minutes behind schedule so we did not get to the reportedly wonderful lounge but stood in line to board and waited and waited. Flight eventually took off nearly two hours late. Priority boarding OK and a very helpful ground staff who checked that our baggage had been safely transferred. Clean and comfortable Business cabin A330 300 with flat beds and 2x2x2 configuration. Full cabin tiny loos. We sat at the gate for more than an hour with no explanation or apology from the flight deck and took off just before 10pm. Cold drinks before take off champagne after take off dry tepid towel offered. The meal was good but not fantastic and each course took so long to come. Not to use trolleys in a full cabin may look good but slows things down so much. No proper wine glasses we were given our second requested glass of champagne in a large water tumbler! This lack of style and training was obvious at all times. FAs were friendly and obliging but not confident or capable as on many other premium airlines. One had so little English she could not understand us or we her. Good choice of entertainment but the amenities bag was awful. Posh bag very little inside no face cream and the slippers had been used and recycled. Poor storage and FAs had no idea what to do with pillows and duvets once passenger luggage was in the racks. Completed breakfast orders were not collected but we handed ours over. The hot part of breakfast was worse than any premium cabin we've flown in: flabby white toast inedible unseasoned eggs. No announcement from the flight deck about our lateness of arrival or apology/explanation of why. No local time check either and when we asked a FA he got it wrong by an hour! Hope our return trip is better.,Passive

Helsinki - Istanbul - Cape Town. Service and food in economy were great in modern day standards. Multi-course dinner with wine and spirits served even on the 3-hour Helsinki-Istanbul -flight.

Great service from the hard working and friendly crew from Washington Dulles to Istanbul flight TK008. I was given emergency exit seat - being 6 foot 6 inches tall it was highly appreciated. The drink selection and quality of food is good - the best I have had on an airline. The plane was clean and bathrooms were well maintained. The service even in economy was of good quality and crew are professional and friendly. I will fly with Turkish again. The crew take pride in their job and go out of their way to accommodate. I enjoyed the blanket slippers and inflight entertainment. I continued on to Amsterdam on TK1955 and received the same high quality service.,Promoter
Istanbul to Washington TK007 on Nov 272014. Flight was not full and I had 3 seats to myself in the back of the plane next to the bathrooms and food cart storage closets. This is a busy area but the extra room was worth it. I can only say great things about this airline. The crew work very hard to make sure everyone is well taken care of. Turkish delight at beginning of flight is a nice touch. Drinks were served throughout the trip and were of good quality. The food was of excellent quality for an airline and all in all I really like the feel and modern clean design of the cabin. Seats appeared to be new and were comfortable. I had plenty of room for my knees which was a relief being that I am 6.5 feet tall. In flight entertainment system and film selection is top notch. I was so thankful to have chosen this airline as the price was a great deal and the staff were professionals. Landed Thanksgiving evening right on time. What more could you want in an airline.

GRU-IST 19/12. Could not upgrade to Premium Economy as the flight was overbooked. I have to say this is the first time I felt like the cabin crew did not care that much for passengers. Food was also of a lower quality than usual. Istanbul-Venice 21st December. Flew on a 738 with no private screen. Cabin crew was fantastic on this flight.

The seat comfort on three segments was slightly disappointing as the seats were identical to economy class ones just the middle seat blocked off with the sole exception of the IST-ASM flight that featured the new business class configuration. The food offered on board by DO&CO was fresh and generous in both quality and quantity without being to overwhelming. The ambience and general service on board was genuine and of high standard without being too pompous as with most premium products. The cabin crew were extremely polite and professional and most seemed to be warm and quite friendly. Ataturk Airport is wide and spacious offering all functioning facilities the security procedures are very lenient and quickly handled with no hassle or long waiting. The customer service staff at Ataturk Airport are satisfactory as most don't seem very keen to assist you although they do their jobs.

TK33 Economy IAH to SSH via Istanbul on November 21 and again November 30 2014. TA exceeded my expectations in all aspects of the flight. Food on the flight was abundant and of a very good quality. Staff were attentive and helpful throughout the whole flight. Inflight entertainment was varied with pretty good choices. Seat was ok but after a 14 hour flight everything seems a little uncomfortable I guess. The only negative was perhaps the craziness encountered at Istanbul Ataturk airport and the uncaring attitude of people at the airport. TA is pretty good value for money and I will not hesitate to use it again in the near future.,Promoter
All flights on time Edi to Istanbul to Singapore and back. Disappointed with 1st flight no welcome on board and certainly no smiles only 6 passengers in business class. 2nd flight lovely welcome smiling staff food excellent lots of tasty dishes small helpings and freshly prepared.

No priority boarding. Istanbul airport huge difficult to find your way about and staff rude and very unhelpful. Still using buses to take you from plane to airport.,Passive
After my outward bound flight from Amsterdam to Kathmandu (TK1952 and TK726) I was ready to write a rampage of discontent if the return flight was anything as bad. For almost a month from mid-November the Istanbul-Kathmandu sector had never been less than four hours late except for two or three days when it left Istanbul two hours early! On the day we travelled there was a six hour delay meaning we had to wait at Istanbul airport for 10 hours. No excuse or apology was offered. When we eventually boarded they had changed the aircraft from the day before when we had booked our seats online so we found ourselves sitting in seats next to the toilets and with no recline. There was also no IFE. Clearly the aircraft was from another era. An hour after we eventually took off (0200) and when I was finally nodding off to sleep I was rudely awoken by one of the crew and offered breakfast - at 0300! I was also offered wine with breakfast! So it was with some trepidation that I awaited my return journey fully expecting a long delay and wait at Kathmandu Airport which is no pleasure! Fortunately from two days before my departure the flight was running on time. What a different experience. A new(er) plane that had IFE an excellent service from the cabin crew on both flights. Why travellers to Kathmandu were singled out for such delays when nearly all long haul flights are on time remains a mystery. Because of the risk of it happening again I would not fly Turkish Airlines to this destination but otherwise I find them more than acceptable.,Detractor
Good service from crew on Dub/Istanbul leg in newish 737. Istanbul to Tbilisi on Airbus. On return to London via Istanbul flight out of Tbilisi was cancelled due to fog.

Upon arrival at IST I was sent to a hotel for the night as I had missed my connecting flight to Helsinki. I was re booked onto the flight the following morning. I arrived in Helsinki 19 hours late.

Turkish Airlines staff are normally brusque and indifferent but when one of their flights is delayed they really excel themselves in terms of inscrutable disdain. Firstly TK0805 to Istanbul (5/11/14) the cabin crew didn't seem to think anyone had the right to know whether we were going or not. When we finally took off over an hour late they were affronted that passengers might want to know if we were going to meet the connecting Turkish flight to London. So not having an answer and not seeming to care they just blithely said 'yes it'll be held'. Everyone rushed to the gate. Low and behold it wasn't held. Sent from pillar to post to interact with various other stony-faced employees who frankly don't care. Not a single person ventured an apology.,Detractor
Brussels to Istanbul. The plane was clean and smart and the staff were helpful and well turned out. Standards of English from staff were also very good. The food was very tasty. The inflight entertainment didn't appear to work in any seat on the inward flight though it was good on the outward flight with a decent choice of movies and TV shows. You are offered a piece of Turkish delight after take off which is a nice touch. Turkish Airlines is significantly better than its home airport.,Passive
TK60 from IST to KUL in economy. Food and beverage service was as good as the food itself definitely 4-star standard. However the crew had a new trick which I have not seen before: One of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use. It was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it. Reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea. To add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage. Wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response. I recommend taking rubber boots on your next TK flight.,Detractor
Istanbul-London Heathrow. Bus to the aircraft â€“ happens so often these days at Istanbul. The chicken meal had run out by the time the cart reached me. Meal I had was good and I relaxed for the rest of the flight. On descent they announced that they would come round for newspapers cups etc but they did not. During the taxi to the gate people started getting up all over the aircraft even though there had been an announcement not to do so but none of the crew attempted to stop them. Luggage was already on the carousel when we arrived. The flight itself was good but efficiency of the crew in my area was appalling.,Passive
I flew business Dublin to Bangkok via Istanbul. First leg of the trip was ok on par with premium economy but no business class. The leg from Istanbul to Bangkok was the worst flight I have had. We arrived late into Istanbul from Dublin and were running late to catch the connecting flight aircrew told us that ground staff were waiting to escort us once we had disembarked well once we had been dumped by the bus at the terminal gate there was no staff to help just the usual mess in Istanbul. We eventually found our gate which lucky for us was running late. So as business class we had priority boarding but in reality this was only onto to the bus which then with everyone else on the flight dumped us in the pouring rain at the rear of the aircraft and we had had to fight our way through to our seats at the front. We took our seats and after some time were offered some water or juice â€“ same as economy. There were 5 airline staff looking after a full business class plus the 2 chefs. The service offered did not reflect. About half an hour after take off face wipes were offered however mine was cold and smelt -â€“not offered a replacement. We were offered a drink I chose champagne which when arrived hardly wet the glass with the quantity given and was warm. A short time later the meal was served which was ok and edible. I managed to get 2 glasses of wine from the crew during the meal. Crew were in a hurry to get your trays packed away and 2.5 hours into the flight all alcohol was locked away and never seen again. Crew took themselves of to hide behind their curtains and not to be seen until 2 hours before we landed when a miserable breakfast was served which I had not ordered. There was 1 business class toilet to service the crew and passengers and the crew seemed to have it in use 80% of the time in the last hour when most passengers were also trying to use it. There were no amenities in the toilet hard paper towels no small cups sink was filthy floor wet. Finally after disembarking in Bangkok getting through customs etc quickly through to the baggage carousel I expected that our bags would be out quickly as we had priority baggage no they came out last and after just about every one else had left the Airport. I have flown Turkish economy before and have found them to be very good and thought that business class would be good but it was awful.,Detractor
Flew IAD-AMM and return from Malta to IAD in November. Flew Business Class round trip. Can't say enough good about the flights as everything from check in to landing went on-time smooth with excellent service both on the ground and in-flight. Considering that I saved over $1000 per person on this routing compared to BA LH and any of the domestic carriers - their in-flight service was far superior to the other transatlantic carriers I've flown over the past 25+ years. Would compare their service to Cathay Pacific. The meal service was outstanding. I've never had meals of this quality before on any airline in First or Business Class. You have to experience it to believe it. Great value for the price I paid and the wonderful service received. Any future business I have going that way - I'm sure to fly Turkish again.,Promoter

We flew Frankfurt-Istanbul-Nevsehir return in Oct 2014. First legs were in time flight Cappadocia-IST started half an hour later arrival IST-FRA was 2 hours late.

We used Turkish on 5 segments for a group trip where many members arrived in IST for a 2 week trip. Of the 22 members of the group who arrived from all corners of the world nearly everyone had a story about Turkish failings. Business class on TK46 from IST to KIX was a perfect example. Plane was a beat up 330-200. Boarding was a mess. Loaded onto a bus in IST in the rain. Driven around the tarmac for 15 minutes to our plane. All passengers loaded through the rear of the plane on a mobile jetway in the rain. To get to the business cabin we had to 'swim upstream' to our seats. After settling in to 4a and 4b (in the beat up cabin) discovered that the toilets (tried to find a clean one of the 4) had not been cleaned. The cabin crew could not be bothered. The seats are not lay flat. The remote did not work. Don't believe the hype.,Detractor
I had a short 2-hr flight from Naples to Istanbul before transferring to JFK-NY. It was a full flight and they were far over their overhead storage capacity by about 8 carry-on suitcases. Often you'll be a few spaces short but I've seldom seen that many. I imagine the problem was caused because the airline check-in agent was not enforcing the 1 carry-on 1 personal item (which is to be pushed under seat or held on your lap) policy. This is negligence on the airlines part. However the flight attendants did the right thing by keeping on the carry-on luggage onboard and not putting it beneath the plane therefore allowing us to be on our way quickly. They offered excellent service with full meal alcoholic beverages and newspapers offered free on a 2-hr flight. The service on the flight from Istanbul to JFK was also quite good. However for whatever reason they did not allow you to pick your seat when you book (at least the system didn't when I tried) so as I result I got stuck in a middle seat which I always try to avoid.,Promoter
Avoid this airline and avoid any transit through Istanbul. Recently flew with Turkish Airlines LHR-IST-TLV-IST- LHR. Cabin crew are cold unfriendly and indifferent to passengers. I was on a scheduled connection home from TLV via Istanbul with a one hour connection time. By the time the aircraft parked offloaded passengers and we cleared security in the transfer lounge I arrived at the gate 10 min before he next departure time only to be told that the flight had closed and I couldn't board. I was given a seat on the next flight home to London (1 hour 40 mins later) only to arrive in LHR with no luggage! Turkish Airlines is chaotic and so is Istanbul airport. Terrible airline and terrible airport!,Detractor
50 minutes late pushing back on the Paris to Istanbul leg and again on the return it was 50 minutes late. Pleasant food but business class seats the same as economy. Rather disappointing as very expensive. The staff were polite.,Detractor

Two completely different experiences. Took a flight from Los Angeles to Istanbul. It was fabulous! Even in coach! The flight staff was so pleasant and attentive. Took the flight back from Istanbul to Los Angeles and it was a completely different story. The flight crew was absent. In 13 hours the beverage cart came by twice and only to serve meals. The crew at the gate were so rude and disorganized. By the end of the flight there was trash everywhere. I was shocked on upon exiting the plane that even First Class was a pig sty. They did offer cheese sandwiches and drinks if you walked to the back of the plane but it was an absolute madhouse. I did nothing but rave about my experience until my return flight. Sad to say that I'd probably never fly TK again.,Passive
As frequent traveller with M&M Elite status receiving priority luggage delivery at airport I can't understand why TGS is not able to deliver priority bags in time where do other airports like Brussels CDG Athens Zagreb Sofia to mention only some can deliver priority luggage maximum 30 minutes after landing. I'm travelling on average three times a month always with 3 bags. Out of the three bags two are tool boxes. Only TGS can't deliver my bag and tool boxes in time. Average 60 minutes I have to wait in Istanbul which is not acceptable. Here TK and TGS should improve urgently.,Passive
I had excellent flights PAR-DYU-PAR by Turkish airlines. The economy seat comfort was satisfactory for the space the entertainment and the service. Staff was very friendly and professional food and drinks were of high quality and good quantity. I really appreciate that sandwiches were served after dinner as the second service for IST-DYU flight (about 5 hours flight). I am frequent traveler and I always prefer to travel with Lufthansa and Turkish airlines especially in economy so I recommend it to everyone.,Promoter
My recent flight on Turkish Airlines was with mixed emotion. Inflight service was excellent. We flew with Turkish Airlines from Dubai to Athens with one stop in Istanbul. The flight from Dubai to Istanbul was 40 minutes late and we missed the flight from Istanbul to Athens by 5 minutes. One would think that since it is the same airline and they knew their flight was late which contained passengers going onto a connecting flight to hold the flight for 5 minutes and also have staff waiting at the exit gate of the first flight to express process passengers in order to make the second flight. I was traveling with my pregnant wife and we had to wait another 5 hours for the next flight. Two other couples were not so lucky as they had a connecting flight to Skopje and they had to wait until the next day. They were given the choice of sleeping in the airport lounge or to pay for a visa for each person to sleep in a hotel outside the airport. One of the couples had a baby who would've been about a year old. We were compensated with a measly food voucher worth no more then 4 Euros each. There was a huge line at the flight services counter with many people experiencing the same issue with connecting flights. It seems they have not got the hang of how connecting flights should work and the gap between the flight times.,Detractor

Rome to Istanbul. The original flight was initially delayed but we were given little information. Eventually we were told another aircraft would be coming from Istanbul and we would be given a meal. There were so many restrictions and inconsistencies with the meal provided. Information on the flight was not available despite several requests. Inaccurate information was given regarding the need to change boarding passes. The ground staff were next to useless and when the supervisor eventually arrived he was boarding of downright aggressive and would not rectify our problem with boarding passes. The flight was underwhelming. Inflight entertainment system was not working and my requested special meal was not available. On landing passengers were walking around the aircraft as it was moving. The cabin crew did nothing and even laughed at the child running up and down the aisle as the aircraft was moving.,Detractor
BRU-IST-BRU c class - rather smooth check in BRU. Used fast track and lounge. TK uses SN lounge in Brussels which is always too crowded understaffed and unclean with little food choices. Especially if you bear in mind 2 UA flights 1 AC and one Hainan plus all of El Al and Turkish and all of SN and other Star Alliance flights all sharing this non Schengen lounge at the same time! Too vile and disgusting. No Senator members lounge at all! Even Vienna has got one. Boarding was the usual TK mess but must say flight ok A320 excellent configuration and experienced staff. Expecting an A330 as earlier planned but change of plane (must say not enough pax). Arrival in IST using fast track arrivals plus optional lounge in IST a breeze. Return again smooth check in Istanbul plus fast track plus lounge a breeze and absolutely exquisite for a business class lounge! Now boarding was the usual TK mess remote gate and all that jazz on board crew too busy arguing about something or other and service was dull and boring but efficiently done! disembark ok no fast track no need really in BRU and suitcase one of the first out! good. Will think twice before recommending though.,Passive
First time on Turkish this summer. Flew From JFK to Tirana via Istanbul and return from Podgorica via Istanbul. Although I had some reservations flying with Turkish at the end I was more than happy that I chose them. The meal service was excellent. Best meal I ever had on a transatlantic flight. The A330-300 was comfortable and the flight entertainment had great variety of movies and games to choose from. I reserved our seats 3 months in advance by calling the call center. Our seats were all promised as we originally chose them on all flight segments. Again I will fly Turkish again on my next transatlantic flight with no reservation.,Promoter
Bad: I flew many times between London and Istanbul always on business class. I have had enough of it. Their planes are old seats are most uncomfortable little leg room same seat as economy but with spare seat in the middle. They also always make you take shuttle bus to terminal both inbound and outbound most inconvenient. I had to help carrying the luggage up the steps for an elderly lady. Hate it they think it is a popular routes so why bother improving it! Wrote to customer service twice no response! Good: Better food and lounge than BA.,Detractor
I made 2 trips to Dhaka last year and both ways missed the connecting flight in Istanbul. The reason is very short lay over time which is only one hour.

Recently I travelled with them on four sectors each averaging 2.5 hours. The gimmick of a crew member wearing a chef's outfit is just that - a gimmick. Service onboard is hit and miss. On some flights it's good on others it's mediocre. There are better airlines operating in Europe.,Detractor
"Non-stop from Istanbul arriving in Boston 30 minutes late. My husband and I chose TA for non-stop reasons because we are in our 80's and wanted to avoid mid-journey transfer. Both trips exceeded our expectations. Chose business class had row 2 each way with just two seats long enough for us to really stretch out and sleep. Cabin was quiet and darkened for relaxing. Food and wine choices were fine and nicely presented. Even ""candlelight"" via a tiny paper lantern with battery light inside. Staff very helpful. Only complaints are the long wait for baggage in Boston and confusing / absent signage for boarding at Istanbul Airport.",Promoter
BEY-LHR via Istanbul. Flight was delayed by 45 mins to depart from Beirut. Flight was packed from Beirut to Istanbul operated by an old A321 with no personal TV. To be honest one of the things that was brought to my attention the carelessness of the cabin crew in checking seat belts and providing the appropriate safety demonstrations no announcement was made from the captain at all during the whole flight. Nevertheless once we got to Istanbul I nearly made my connecting flight to LHR. Again flight was operated by an A321 with no ptv which I found very surprising. Again service was not great however they served good food. Overall would not fly again with them due to their very tired aircraft's being used on the route and due to the service of both the cabin crew and the hassle for connecting passengers in Istanbul.,Detractor
IST-VCE-IST - Boarded pretty much on time but departed Istanbul 1 hour late with the aircraft sitting on the tarmac with Ataturk airport almost always congested that's nothing new. Cabin very hot and stuffy until the end of the flight. Of course no beverage service until 40 minutes into the flight. 737-900ER which looked brand new cabin very clean nice looking seats but with typical THY pitch so not much space to move. Reclining button missing/broken so impossible to move the backrest. Nice choice of movies on the IFE and big screen when the thing worked the whole system rebooted on all seats after a while and my lucky colleague next to me has his rebooted a dozen times or more until the flight attendant attempted to fix it by rebooting it a few more times and then gave up. Service as usual with THY OK if you don't expect too much the only friendly and smiling stewardess was the one who did not speak any English. Return flight on A321-200 departed on time from VCE and full almost to the last seat. Good for them. Slow food service with only 2 stewards each with one trolley and that took ages mine ran out of beef kebab after the 10th row. The 2 of us had beef served cold and mine was some kÃ¶fte dish which was not even on the menu. I guess it was some leftover from a previous flight and re-heated twice the lid was already open and it was stone cold. My colleague had the time to finish watching his movie from the previous flight and arrival was on time in IST. Every time I am stuck with flying Turkish I wonder how they manage to get Europe's best airline award and now for the 3rd year. I guess the people who evaluate do not fly the same routes as me and never in economy.,Detractor
Another fantastic journey with Turkish Airlines. Sao Paulo-Istanbul: flew Comfort class which in my opinion is excellent value for money. Seats were only 50% taken in this class and I could thus enjoy three seats free for me. The space and comfort of this class is comparable to Business class of many other airlines. The seat is wide the space for legs is exceptional the IFE was also nice with noise cancelling earphones distributed. Service: top notch. Food was of very good quality in abundance and served with almost Business class layout (real plates and real towels) both for breakfast and the dinner served two hours before landing in Istanbul. Cabin crew was discreet but always present when needed: I asked twice for some juice and had the glass delivered at my seat within a couple of minutes. Did land in IST after 12 hours and 45 minutes with a delay of 2 minutes. I just keep recommending this airline.,Promoter

"I read some variable reviews before booking my flights from NJ to Istanbul so decided against direct flight and booked United to Munich then TA to Istanbul then TA back to Frankfurt and Lufthansa back to NJ. TA was by far the best parts of the trip with over-the-top service plenty of stretch room in business class (I'm 6'1"") and solid quality food. I liked the repeated options to grab another croissant / roll or requests whether I wanted a refill of wine or coffee. The Airbus A330s I flew were new and immaculate. My only complaint was the boarding process which wasn't well organized in Munich at all with a long narrow gate where everyone across all classes congregated and blocked any chance for an organized boarding. Had I not been near the front I would have been one of the last to board despite my business class seat and never heard a call for that class to board. The return trip was a bit better with the gate agent asking out loud - not over the PA - whether anyone was in business class and directed us to a separate line that was initially hidden from view. I would definitely recommend TA to other passengers traveling in business class and would take fly with them again if given the option.",Promoter
Flew Montreal-Istanbul-Bangkok business class. On both legs the flight was fantastic the food was in abundance almost feeling like there was too much. Inflight entertainment was great. The first flight had the side by side seats that go into full sleep position and were great. The 2nd leg had the pods which I actually found slightly less comfortable. The service was great except for one thing on my Montreal flight when I had to ask 3 times for some water. I still find their inflight service excellent and very attentive.,Promoter
"My husband and I took four economy flights in the last couple of weeks between London and Antalya via Istanbul. We chose Turkish Airlines over the lower cost carriers as it has won several awards and had better arrival times than Easyjet etc. Check in at LHR was chaotic and staff were disinterested and inefficient. The flight was delayed. In fact all four flights were delayed. We were unable to book legroom seats on the first flight (my husband is 6'6"") but were able to move once the flight was underway. As we were going through the gate for the second flight the staff grabbed my boarding pass took a pen and scrubbed out my seat number and changed it. When I asked why (no explanation was volunteered) I was told the plane had changed. On boarding I was in an entirely different part of the plane to my husband in between members of a young family despite there being spaces next to my husband. Needless to say I moved once the flight was underway. No apologies from staff. On arrival international passengers were separated from domestic and taken to the international terminal to receive our suitcases. After waiting for a long time (late in the evening) someone eventually came and told us we had been sent to the wrong terminal. No apologies. No directions as to how to get into the arrivals hall of the domestic terminal. Eventually found it - everyone else from the flight were long gone. On arrival at Antalya airport 2 weeks later to take our two flights home check in again was chaotic. Asked for legroom seats - we're given them for the first flight but not the second. No explanation or apology. Legroom was non existent - even I struggled to fit. My husband found it impossible. We asked if it was possible to move and we're told no - no explanations or apologies. Again others were seated separately and there were a couple of heated conversations which the staff dealt with very poorly. Once the flight was underway and the seatbelt signs were off my husband stood up finding a spot out of everyone's way. The person in front reclined their seat making it impossible to sit back down when told to do so. My husband explained this politely to a very abrupt attendant and was told in no uncertain terms to sit. No care understanding or apologies. I pleaded with the guy in front to put his seat upright and my husband retook his seat. His knees were up against the seat in front and the magazine rack cut into his shins. Food dreadful. Seatbelt signs kept on for most of flight and flight attendants almost invisible for the rest of the journey.",Detractor
Milan-Istanbul-Sao Paulo. Milan-Istanbul: quite old Airbus A320 with limited entertainment onboard. As usual excellent hot meal distributed. Very nice and efficient cabin crew. Long transfer at IST Ataturk Airport. For such a reason Turkish paid a very nice hotel for me (5 stars) located in the city center. Free transfers also provided both ways. Istanbul-Sao Paulo: 13 hours daily flight aboard a new 773-full flight. I got the emergency exit which means a lot of space for a better rest. The 3-3-3 seat configuration in Economy is extremely appreciated and TK is one of the few airlines world-wide which still keeps it nowadays. Very young and pleasant cabin crew. Meals: overall two hot meals - tasty and well-presented. IFE completed with a wide range of movies and TV programs. Live TV and free-wifi onboard definitely a plus. First long-haul flight with Turkish. Can definitely keep recommending.,Promoter

"Travelled VIE-IST-JFK-IST-Vie at the end of July. We booked Premium Economy with TK to N.Y. for a family trip as TK offers best value in this class (only slightly more expensive than the cramped Y-class on any direct flight from Vienna to N.Y. in peak season unfortunately there is no Premium-Y ex Vienna). 3 days befor departure we received note from TK that due to an aircraft switch ""Comfort Class"" (only on TK's 777) would not be available on the 10-hour flight from IST to JFK thus we were offered a later flight. I requested an update to C-class instead which was duly granted - a great move from TK and just what I expected from ""Europe's best airline""! Our 2-hour morning flight to IST in Y-class was comfortable sufficient legroom menu cards were distributed and a hot and tasty breakfast was served (fantastic service having in mind what other airlines consider as catering). Our connecting flight was in C-class so we enjoyed the marvellous TK lounge at IST airport that streches over 5000 square metres on two levels - try the freshly brewed Turkish Coffee! The flight to JFK on an Airbus A-330 in business class was as comfortable as it can get (welcome drink fluffy duvets flat beds Do&Co flying cooks meal courses were served one after the other as it should be dedicated and smiling FAs a wide range of movies). Bottomline: we arrived relaxed and happy. Only a minor point: cabin design could be slightly more colourful. Unfortunately our flight back to Vienna via IST was not upgraded so we travelled in ""Comfort Class"" as planned. Seats are in CC are wide and legroom is plenty. There were no welcome drinks and meal service started way behind C-Class (keep in mind that the flight departed at midnight!) but the meals dinner and a full hot breakfast before landing all served on china were tasty and satisfying. The amenity bag distributed in ""Comfort Class"" wasn't Porsche-design like in business but nevertheless came in very handy. At IST we spent some time at the ""Prime Class Lounge"" (we pre-booked this service before we departed) where you can take a relaxing shower after a long-distance flight. The final leg of our journey took us back to Vienna in Y-class in the late afternoon. Again menu cards with an extra drink/wine-list were distributed prior to dinner service once again an amazing service by TK considering the occasional sachet of pretzels - it at all! - other airlines serve on 2 hour flights.

Booked Business Class BHX to DEL via IST. Business Class Service on the BHX to IST very hit and miss. Steward seemed nervous took my order for drink and forgot to bring me the drink. Later on during the flight the FA took my order for a drink and this one came. Flight attendant serving drinks without bringing them on a serving tray certainly shows me that the Turkish Airways staff need training and overall the service in business class was poor. The lounge at Istanbul is very good. Istanbul to Delhi boarding a shambles. No segregation between Business Class and Economy on boarding especially if you have to travel to the plane by bus. IST TO DEL - one of the most uncomfortable business class seats in the air. I travelled on 22/8/2014. I am going to travel in Business Class on the same route BHX to DEL VIA IST on October and I am hoping for better service.

Traveling from St Petersburg to Istanbul in business class - very disappointed the business class on this ageing 757-800 was no better than economy class. The seats were economy did not recline more than 15 degrees. The centre seat of an economy row was made inactive by folding it down. Hence calling the two seat arrangement business class.

HKG-IST-OSL-IST-PEK. Economy Comfort on the long-haul legs are superb and did actually not cost much more than a standard economy ticket when you book 5-6 months in advance. TK are superb and in many ways in a different league when it comes to their food. Every meal I ate everything something which happens rarely for me. The entertainment system is excellent and the FAs are good. The only negative thing is information flow,Promoter
TK 2421 Antalya to Istanbul August 11. TK 66 Istanbul to Jakarta August 12. We have always enjoyed TK and have flown it many places around the world each time in Business Class. There does seem to be a difference in both the service and attitude on the 330 vs 777 airplanes. The 777 FA's are more caring and do not disappear after service. After numerous long haul flights is seems that the FA's on the 330 are less trained and really do not care. Yesterday on the Istanbul to Singapore flight a FA attendant was smashing the pillows and blankets into the overhead compartments even if they were full of luggage. It was a disaster trying to get the hand carry out of the overhead because of all the bedding. Another thing is the food. When a flight leaves Istanbul at 1 am on a 10 hour flight the most important meal is breakfast not dinner. We have yet to have an edible breakfast even in Business Class. The eggs are a messy runny non-recognizable mess or there was some mystery Turkish pastry breakfast that was like rubber. You would think that with nobody eating the entrÃ©e that they would stop serving it. The funny thing is that the meals served in the European Business Class are quite good. The Business Class lounge in Istanbul remains the best in the world. We love spending time there. Unfortunately they boast if having thousands of flights daily but the airport in Istanbul cannot handle nearly as many as they want to fly. The taxi ways and concourses are a disaster. You would think there would be separate lines for Business and Economy like the rest of the airlines in the world but no. We will continue to fly Turkish Airlines because we feel safe and the price is right. Occasionally we get a good flight crew. But it is all hit and miss. The one consistent thing about Turkish Airline is that you cannot apply one word or phrase to describe them because they always are different.,Passive
BUD-IST-KIX (Istanbul-Osaka) and return. Short range A320 and B737-800 were a bit tighter seated but the A332 on IST-KIX and back was very spacious. We took row 32 or so (do your online check-in 24 hrs in advance) where config is only 2x3x2 - legroom was great. Seat comfort for my 90 kgs also acceptable but a bit high armrests. Food was plentiful and excellent in quality with metal cutlery (long gone since the '90-s from most fights unfortunately) even trilingual menu cards were provided on all legs with 2 choices on the long range ones. Both long ranges being (mostly) night fights cabin attendants got all window blinds closed after service so all pax could sleep rather well - even on the backwards leg where plane was 90% loaded. Cabin crew were very attentive and thorough - what I rate the most is that they checked all seat belts and seat tray window blind etc. before landing and got everything arranged right. Toilets were kept clean in the aft cabin all the way through free beverages and snack stocks were kept available constantly. Inflight entertainment runs (obviously) on some Android old op.sys tablets integrated into seat backs and mine was stuck somehow though but did not ask for assistance. Flights were punctual (no delays) and crew were smiling.,Promoter
Flew Nairobi-IST-Boston return. While aircraft and cabin were fine food definitely above average and a bird strike was professionally and safely handled by the pilot (take off aborted switch to new aircraft) I was not happy with the following: 1) Very difficult to get hold of Turkish Airlines office by phone. I wanted to inquire about changes to my ticket. In Nairobi I had to end up making the journey to their downtown office in person because no one answered the phone. In the US it was equally difficult to get hold of anyone who could help with ticket changes. You can also only pay any change fees in person at the airport (this alone took an hour prior to the actual check in and ended up being USD 80 higher than originally advised). In Boston there is also no on- line check in available. Turkish is just not equipped with the kind of services that makes this much easier with airlines like KLM BA Delta etc. 2) Horrible experience at Istanbul airport. Again wanted to go to a ticket office to inquire about changes during my layover. In the entire international transit area there is none! It was also incredibly difficult just to find someone who spoke adequate English! After going in circles I was finally told I need to get a visa exit the airport go to the ticket office outside then re-enter! It was also by far the dirtiest airport I have been to hardly saw cleaning crews and if I did they were standing around talking rather than working. Neither ground staff nor cabin crew particularly friendly on a four leg trip one flight attendant stood out for trying to be particularly helpful. I had chosen Turkish because at the time it was the cheapest option the few hundred dollars saved were not worth it because of the other hassles gained. The early morning departure and arrival times in Nairobi also make an already long trip even more painful.,Detractor

Flew IAH-IST in business. Cabin was nicely appointed and comfortable and the inflight entertainment works well. The food and drinks offered were high quality and plentiful except my fish entree was over cooked. The service was awkward. It was a full hour after takeoff before the in flight service was started. Food was prepared in the forward galley and plated in the rear galley which meant there was constant cabin staff traffic between the two galleys making the cabin environment frenetic. Beverages were only offered once at the beginning of the meal service. Any additional beverages including water required a direct request with an attendant who would then readily provide another beverage.,Promoter
LHR - Istanbul - North Cyprus - Istanbul - LHR. Business class to Istanbul economy to North Cyprus. Flight to Istanbul departed on time. A321 seats not really business more economy plus as it's 3 seats across with the centre seat blocked off and a little more leg room. Very early AM flight breakfast good flight nearly full. Entertainment not that good. One hour transfer time at Istanbul was no problem at all in fact we did it in 10 minutes. Flight to North Cyprus B737-800 seat ok food surprisingly served on an hour flight entertainment system not fantastic. Flight from Istanbul to LHR was just fantastic mainly because of the Turkish business lounge which is as far as I am concerned is the best of the best. Food space comfort facilities all there in this brand new lounge all excellent. Flight on B737-800. Aircraft type changed at the last minute so passengers seated all over the place. Everyone seemed civilised onboard and just swapped seats onboard so couples could sit together. Chef onboard and food prepared by DoCo just sumptuous. Cabin crew all male in business were terrific.

On arrival at Istanbul received the worst customer service experience. Staff rude unhelpful and incompetent. No bookings for onward flight found initially told we would have to overnight in Istanbul only after continued insistence with staff were seats found for us.

Way back it was worse: Checked in but was not offered an invitation to the lounge so I had to bribe someone to get me that instead of again going through security. Then 75 min departure delay without any notice information etc. which made me miss my connection in Istanbul. The onboard entertainment system was completely off apologies for the technical defect.

While the flights we've had over the years have been good in terms of food price in-flight service and entertainment etc today was quite the opposite. My wife and kids flew to Istanbul from Macedonia intending to get on a flight to Chicago. Instead they were told at the gate that the boarding passes they had received for the flight were not adequate and there were no seats for them. They were turned away and sent to a ""help desk"" that was a nightmare.

Boarded in Istanbul and the check-in staff couldn't have been less helpful. The first person at the check-in counter passed me off onto someone else because of what she called a 'ticket problem' before promptly going on her break. The second person was slightly more helpful up until the point someone came around and told him to go on a break. Then it became too hard to do anything more than check me in onto the Turkish airlines flight. He wouldn't check my bag through to Sydney no real reason given but from previous experience it is possible to check bags through despite different airlines in operation. This meant that once I arrived in KL I had to clear customs pick up my bag and then check back in again. A massive pain and something that wouldn't have been achievable if I had had less than 3 hours between flights. First and last flight with Turkish Airlines!,Detractor
TK12 and TK571 JFK-IST-JRO departing July 3rd 2014. Had multiple terrible experiences with TK in the last year the most recent of them in July 2014 on the first flight of our honeymoon! Every time I have flown with TK from JFK or BRU the flight was late by more than 90min without any explanation. Leading to a missed connection and being stranded against our will in Istanbul. Each time the in-flight crew assured us the connecting flight would be informed and wait for us. Each time there was no one upon landing to direct us and help us find our connection gate. Each time we missed the connecting by less than 10min after desperately running across the airport to try and make it. Each time the ground staff for luggage collection and transfer/hotel arrangements were unduly rude and totally unhelpful. And the hotel provided for the night was very sub-standard. And each time we had to pay an entry visa that we would otherwise not have had to pay. I have flown a lot of different airlines and this is by far the worst experience I've ever had. In the latest occurrence they would not even make a nice gesture to acknowledge the fact they were ruining the first 2 days of our honeymoon. Needless to say we will never fly Turkish airlines again if we can avoid it.,Detractor

I am much taller than average and have found the latest flights to be torturous in terms of legroom. On my most recent trip I had to skip the meal because I did not have sufficient room over my legs to lower the tray table. Cabin staff were good but ground staff were decidedly a mixed bag in terms of helpfulness. Entertainment consisted of the 1970's-era pop-down screens.

Luggage is rarely lost. Out of 100+ flights it happened once which was likely due to a non-Turkish Airlines connection. Food is halal and of top quality. Most of the fleet is brand new. Once in a while you get an old one which makes the flight experience mediocre. The miles program is great but they started reducing the number of miles that can be earned. One thing annoying is the in-flight announcement. The pilots better stay silent instead of trying to speak with their low- level English.,Promoter

Istanbul to Thessaloniki on a morning flight. Boarded the plane. Two crew were working in the J cabin (including senior crew member). Load of J cabin only 6. They handed out the menu for the service before take-off which had hot breakfast choices. After take-off the crew started the service. Without any interaction the crew member came and passed me the tray. Tray consisted of a fruit yoghurt croissant and a selection of cheese. Never asked me if I would like anything to drink or which hot meal choice I would like. I got up to visit the toilet before the seatbelt sign came on. The J cabin toilet was unusable for its respective cabin customers as the crew allowed a Y cabin customer to use the toilet and he threw a whole tree of paper in the toilet. The other crew member asks me finally if I would like to have anything to drink. Asked for a Turkish coffee. After I came out asked a crew member to take my tray. Then comes my coffee. That's when the seatbelt sign came on. Nobody came to secure the cabin before landing. Landed in Thessaloniki. Waited for our luggage on the carousel only to find the priority bags arriving last. At the end of the day a short flight is a showcase of what a long trip can be with them.,Detractor

Had to ask twice for a fast track card for arrivals in IST check in staff did not even know they existed. and they have 4 flights to IST daily. Lounge is always full and dirty and am afraid boarding is always a mess even you are flying c class. From wait in lounge to designated gate to last call all of this in less than 10 minutes simply ridiculous. Experienced this many time. Once on board all is different - friendly yet professionals staff with lack of language skills but ok on security and service. Some try to go the extra mile. Only option to IST direct. They need to improve ground staff and boarding skills and attitudes otherwise I would perhaps recommend. IST lounge on Sunday 27/07/14 announcement from no info to go to gate to last call gate closed 15 mins.

"JFK-ATH business class round-trip in June (TK0004 & 0001). Departure from JFK was delayed by almost 3 hours as the pilot could not be found. On arrival in Istanbul we had to go the ""transfer desk"" to find a connection to ATH. Said transfer desk has a queue of over 100 people from every conceivable destination and no priority for business class.

BHX-IST-BKK. July 9 2014. Boeing 737-800: BHX-IST. Very impressed with Turkish Airlines European business class. By far the best of all European carriers for comfort and privacy. It offers a 2-2 configuration with 20' leather recliners with additional foot rest. There is a personal VOD monitor in the arm rest with a wide variety of shows and movies for a 3 hour flight. Flight attendants are very polite and professional. Food catering is of the highest standard to match and surpass other European Carriers like BA KLM or Lufthansa. Airbus A330-300: IST-BKK. The TK business class lounge is very impressive with kids room multiple TV rooms 2 grand pianos and some of the cleanest toilets I have seen at an airport. Lounge provides user friendly lockers to store your belongings. A bit chaotic boarding at IST. The shuttle bus used to take passengers to the aircraft was a bit overcrowded and ground staff seemed a bit disorganised. However after boarding it's all up hill. FAs were very attentive and professional. The personalised chef for the forward cabin was a nice touch. Good selection of food and drinks and the inflight entertainment is more than adequate for the 9 hours and 40 mins. Seats are very comfortable for business class with an exceptional amount of leg room although the seat configuration of 2-2-2 does not provide loads of privacy for a single traveler with the two end seats A and K not giving direct aisle access. Overall Turkish Airlines provides a very good product in business. Will definitely recommend and travel again in the future.,Promoter

Travelling from Alanya/Gazipasa to Istanbul via Ankara the first disappointment was that there was no online check-in. At the airport you are allocated a seat which cannot be changed as the system doesn't allow it said the young lady on the desk. No lounge but such a small airport and only one or two flights a day hardly warrant it. In fact the Turkish Airlines printed timetable doesn't even list the flights there. I went into the airport shop for a can of Coke but at TL 7.25 decided it was too much of a rip-off. No priority boarding so a scramble at the gate. Flight operated by Anadolujet was comfortable and a sandwich and water tea and coffee served. At Ankara the domestic transfer passengers were sent straight into the departure area which meant no second security screening. But inside I discovered my next sector was delayed and the Business Class lounge was outside so I could not reach it. Luckily the delay was not long and soon we were boarding. They made an announcement about pre-boarding but then just let everybody go through. Full flight and had another sandwich and cake. After landing at Istanbul we had to sit on the ground with the engines running for 15 minutes before a gate was available. My luggage was the last up - seems they don't use priority tags at Alanya either. But at least I was able to go to the airport shop and buy a can of Coke for TL 1.75!,Detractor

Flew non-stop Houston to Istanbul in Comfort Economy. I had low expectation however it was a pleasant experience. From check-in to boarding the process was well managed. I was greeted with a smile while boarding and found the Comfort Economy area quite spacious. The seats were 2-3-2 with decent cushioning leg room foot rest and in seat IFE. The seats did not allow reclining for a comfortable sleeping position but let's not forget it was $350 more than basic economy fare. Here is the more pleasant part: the cabin crew were full of smiles and were pleasant. No attitude or doing the passengers a favor type behavior. The food service was good and well portioned. I don't get this much polite and pleasant service in business class of major US carriers! The arrival at IST was timely however we parked at a hard stand.

"I have flown with TK a couple of times this year. The majority of flights are disappointing. Most recent flight was on 20 June 2014 from Riyadh (KSA) to Paris (France) via Istanbul. Leg 1: TK141 was delayed (as usual). Flew with an old A321. Very tired and dirty. Business class seat was an economy seat. Most of business class passengers complained about the seats (it was an overnight flight and most of us wanted to sleep - but it was impossible). Crew was ok - nothing exceptional (typical TK). Food was average - I am really wondering why they have the-so called ""Flying-Chef"" on board. Leg 2: TK1821 was delayed as well. Flew with a new A330-300 featuring the new business class. Much space and a fully flat bed. Although business class cabin is spacious it is not sophisticated at all. Cabin was dirty. Food was just ok. Crew was unprofessional and rude.",Detractor
I had return flight CDG-TBS-CDG via Istanbul by Turkish last month. The service overall was really excellent. The food was very good nicely presented and tasty. Cabin attendants were professional in all flights nothing to complain about. Seats are ok for a couple of hours flights with the overhead screens and consequently limited entertainment. I have three observations for improvement: 1) The Business lounge in Sabina airport is very unpleasant a box size room with no edible food available. 2) The Ataturk airport (I had it for return flight) was extremely busy and flights are usually delayed for 30-45 minutes. 3) I observed that the light in cabins during the boarding catering (almost two hours) and landing was extremely bright (it is annoying when there is late evening or night flight). In general Turkish and Lufthansa are the best choices for Tbilisi.,Promoter
Flew from IST to ESB on A321. The Business class configuration is typical of the European short haul flights with the middle seat left empty. Legroom is limited and hardly an improvement over Economy. Aircraft was showing its age and as with all TK flights I have been on the air was stuffy and stale. Flight attendants came across as aloof and did not seem to be interested in engaging with the passengers beyond the most basic requirements of their duties. Good meal service for a short flight. There was moderate turbulence throughout the flight resulting in spilled drinks. The FA's did not bother to clean up the spill on my table even though it was evident at the time they collected the meal service. The crews on TK really need to improve their English skills as their announcements are barely understandable and would represent a real concern in the event of an emergency. As well my experience on all of TK flights leave me questioning the safety culture of the FA's as they tend to ignore basic in-flight safety breaches such as passengers standing up while the aircraft is taxiing and leaving their tables down during takeoff and landings. The flight left late due to congestion at Istanbul airport but was otherwise uneventful. Their domestic service is clearly superior to North American and many European carriers and is certainly good value for money. With some attention to cabin service and improved FA performance this airline can easily maintain its status as Europe's best but has a long way to go to compete with Asian and Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes.,Detractor

IST-LAX flight. It was a B777. The seats were extremely comfortable compared to other transatlantic flight I took over the year (i.e. Mostly Austrian and Lufthansa). The service was excellent. The staff friendly and the food delicious. The plane seemed to me just out of production and the IFE was much better than what I am used to with Austrian (which I prefer generally for financial reasons). The only complaint would be the price you have to pay for THY flights. It is generally 50% more than what Austrian offers.,Promoter
TK21 PEK to IST. Orderly and on time boarding. Was asked to relocate to a different seat than the one pre- assigned in order to accommodate a passenger with physical disability. Ended up in a window seat as no other aisle seats were available. The Purser tried very hard and apologized profusely. A warm approach I am not used to receiving from TK FA's. Cabin as with many TK flights very warm and air stale. Comfortable lie-flat seats with plush blanket and soft pillow. The shell style seats do not offer much storage room and are narrower than other business class seats. Attentive service throughout the flight with FA's frequently checking on passengers. Good meal and wine selection although main course was somewhat tasteless. AVOD system with 20 inch screens and a wide selection of movie and music options although somewhat dated. The highlight of the flight was the free WiFi which is a very nice touch. Overall a pleasant experience.,Passive
TK 0035 IST Ataturk-Montreal June 17 2014. Booking the flight one month in advance: both my travel agent and I tried to secure an exit row seat. I expected to pay for it. The airline was impossible to reach from Canada. At check-in the seat selected by the travel agent was changed to an unacceptable one. A request to upgrade for business cabin was denied. On the ground at Ataturk a long and very slow line-up in the corridor just to enter the gate (an additional security check - we have gone through the passport control as well as the security already). Not a single seat available. The security agents behaved like Canadian immigration officials interrogating people about purposes of their trips but no information was going into computers. Younger people were sitting on the floor older ones standing there with their bags looked tortured already. The plane was jammed full. The seats in Economy were really cramped no legroom (a 10hr flight). Rude FA's and completely devoid of smiles. Dismissive and unhelpful to boot trying to ignore passengers as much as possible. Dirty lavatories with pileups of used paper towels on top of garbage boxes no toilet seats available.,Detractor
I flew Dublin - Istanbul - Doha - Istanbul - Dublin. Business class seats are very uncomfortable with minimal recline think BA Club Europe. Crew would rather be at home no eye contact or smile. EN Route from IST-DOH I was the only person in business class and had to ask the captain and 2 female flight attendants to lower their voice they were literally shouting and laughing it was a 00.35 departure so I wanted to sleep they did not dim the lighting. On the return leg DOH-IST I managed some sleep but was woken by the inflight chef snoring in the seat next to me. IST-DUB I slept through the meal service when I woke I tried to get some water but no one came from the bell I went to the galley which was deserted. There were two flight attendants serving economy class someone came from economy class after about 10 minutes to help me. There is no priority boarding for business class. Great lounge in Istanbul.,Detractor
Flew TK041 from Johannesburg to Istanbul on 12 June. The flight was full and as a result it was one of the most cramped flights I have experienced. Not for the faint hearted. The major issue is the A330's they use on the route are old and tired. The upholstery was worn through and coming apart from the seats. Very tacky for an airline striving to be one of the world's best. There was minimal leg room in fact on sitting down my legs were already jammed into the seat in front. I don't think I would fly with them again - will probably take the longer route via Dubai. Emirates' seats have far more leg room on the 777's. The service itself was great it was just the planes that were awful!,Detractor

VIE-IST on A330. Flight was overbooked in Economy. Although seats in Business Class available it was not possible to upgrade against miles or cash. Cabin chef extremely rude to ground staff and me.

Inflight entertainment not updated since January.,Detractor
Flew TK18 Business Class from Toronto to Istanbul on May 6th code share flight with Air Canada where the ticket was slightly less than through Turkish. Departed on-time. The flight crew were superb attentive and bi- lingual. Great selection of Turkish newspapers including English-language editions. During the over-night flight my wife awoke: A flight crew member immediately came to her to see if there was anything she needed. Food was good as were the entertainment selections. The food and drinks were well presented including â€œcandlelight dinner high above the clouds.â€ The bathroom was kept clean through-out the flight the fresh flowers inside and immediately outside were an unexpected touch. Only complaint was the lack of expedited customs upon arrival. Will fly with Turkish again they certainly provided a high quality international flight.,Promoter
Recently flew Istanbul to New York City in Business Class using United Air Miles. Very comfortable seats which allowed a potential good sleep. Food excellent though it took a long time to serve and we all were anxious to sleep it was evening. There were two problems: the restroom was filthy from the beginning of the flight. Floor was sticky trash overflowed the bins and was on the floor. When I told Flight Attendant I don't believe she really understood. She told me to use the restroom in Business Class but this was in Business Class. Second problem was it seemed families with young children (infants and toddlers) were invited to use Business Class as a free upgrade. This was nice for them but having two screaming youngsters for several hours was hard on the rest of the passengers. Turkish Air has a great reputation so this was a disappointing flight. Check the bathroom!,Passive
VIE-IST-TLV-IST-HAM: Outbound flight from VIE to IST with A 330-200. Much legroom excellent food freshly squeezed juices and very tasty hot meal. Flight attendants were smiling and friendly and did a great job to complete a full service within 2hrs 45 min. Flight left on time arrived on time in IST. Smooth check-in and boarding in Vienna. Transfer at IST airport very easy. Plenty of shops and restaurants the only downside is that there was no airbridge available for the next flight to TLV. No seats available at the departure gate and very cramped. Flight from IST to TLV was excellent. Brand new A321 with personal TV on each seat. Again FA's very friendly and they served a hot meal in the middle of the night (flight was 1 hour 40 min). Return flight from TLV to IST again a very new plane flight left punctual at Ben Gurion airport FA's smiling and friendly all the time. Again a smooth transfer at IST connection to HAM. Older aircraft from IST to HAM but enough legroom even in Y- class. I have no doubt to recommend this airline. Especially the catering and the onboard meals are fresh and tasty from Turkish Do&CO. Turkish is much better than most of the European airlines. Will choose them again.,Promoter
We recently flew from Chicago to Istanbul to Tel Aviv. The experience was very positive but where Turkish Airlines really stood out was in providing gluten free meals. They were of excellent quality and out of four major meals there were no repeats. Really beat the standard white rice and dry white chicken most airlines serve every time. It helped make a long trip easier.,Promoter
BRU-IST-BRU 1 class both legs Boeing 737-800 great C configuration. Good efficient check in and SN lounge not as good as BA which was the usual lounge in BRU. Boarding a mess but once on board rather good service comfort and tranquility Two remarks on board though menus are getting very boring if you fly TK often as I do on European routes and bathrooms are used by everybody and FA do nothing to stop it! Third remark is BRU boarding which is always a mess! Arriving in ST when C pax a bliss due to the fast track on arrivals. Will recommend and use them again already book the next 3 trips!,Promoter
We flew from Rome to Istanbul business class staff food and aircraft were excellent no complaints on this 3.5 hour flight. We then had a two hour wait for our flight to Hong Kong in premium economy on Turkish Airlines. Again everything was excellent. Only thing I could say they should get their boarding process more efficient. Everyone was seated near the boarding counter (flight full or nearly full) we had been sitting there for an hour a person came in and told everyone to move we thought the gate had changed. No. We were moved outside the door past another counter and then had to line up show our boarding pass which part was torn off and then had to sit back where we were originally. Sat there for an hour. After all passengers were seated back where they were the staff member then proceeded to zap all the boarding passes it seemed like 6 times. Why I don't know that is usually done in one process. We then lined up in lines marked A B C D and then flew to HKG. Great flight service and nice clean planes.,Promoter
Delhi to Istanbul was terrible. Old flight with bad quality of seats. The entertainment system was not working for the whole flight. Asked for water as it was peak summer and did not come until the beverages started. The crew were curt. Flight from Istanbul to Sweden was better quality but again food was pathetic. Sweden to Istanbul food was bearable. Istanbul to Delhi - again entertainment was not working. Never again will I take this flight. Thankfully there was 1-2 crew members who were a bit courteous else would have given a single star on each parameter.,Detractor
I've flown with Turkish 4 times since Jan 2014. This weekend (29 May to 1st June) I flew with them again from Riyadh to Geneva and return. First flight Wednesday night was crowded but boarding went well and was relatively quick. Onboard the plane was not clean the supposedly red seats were much more black the carpet was dirty and entertainment system outdated. Flight attendants were rude. The food as usual was quite good. Landing at IST was ok. Airport is not the nicest but not bad. Nevertheless I still do not understand why you have again to go for a full security check while in transit. Then we boarded for GVA starting with a bus ride crossing the taxiway and queuing. The plane was again outdated and not clean at all. Again flight attendants were not smiling and the entertainment system did not exist. Yesterday I did the same trip back same conditions same services same outdated planes.,Detractor
Critical flaw - staff do absolutely nothing to enable best possible chance to make connecting flights. TK feeder flight late leaving Antalya late arriving IST bus 10 minutes around tarmac as no airbridge! No staff waiting to expedite transfers. I am a regular traveller and always every attempt is made to enable connections. It's basic. TK international flight also delayed so not leaving for one hour - staff just tore up my boarding pass rather than even attempting to get me on board! The implication was significant.,Detractor
BRU-IST C class Airbus 330. Good check in and sn lunch. Very busy day at Zaventem full everywhere sn class leaves much to be desired. Boarding messy but once on board all went very smoothly.

"BOS-IST-BOS. The flight was fine but ground crew in both Boston and IST were uncommunicative unhelpful and more involved in talking with each other than in helping passengers. 4 hour delay leaving BOS with promises to update ""in 15 minutes"" no further info for an hour. Nasty little sandwiches provided around 2am but not enough bottles of water to go around. I travel a lot and I've never seen such an unprofessional ground crew. Boarding in IST chaotic. No announcements no signs. Constant ""security checks"" but no computers used so no real verification of identity info. Wanding being done incorrectly. Security staff asking passengers detailed questions about the reasons for going to the US where they were residing etc. as if they were US Immigration - but nothing going into computers to be transmitted to US authorities.",Passive
AMS-IST-AMS Business Class. Their Lounge at AMS has been reduced by 50% which can get uncomfortable during the busy hours. Food and beverages are scarce. But it's a clean friendly environment! A340-300 to IST just a few business class passengers. The seats are worn but not worn-out. I preferred a low calorie meal which turned out to be fish. The meal itself was good enough. We landed on time. My flight outbound from IST is always late no matter the weather. Late boarding late departure. My plane was already there! Service on-board was good. Business load [sold seats] was high. The best part of the trip is the CIP lounge!,Passive
LGW-IST-CPT return. Great value flight. Check in at LGW easy and quick and very pleasant staff member. Simple flight to IST and a 6.5 hour wait with little to do. Recommend Cafe Nero for a really good cup of tea while you wait. Flight to Cape Town was reasonably pleasant but staff were a little sniffy especially the females. Food was fair but nothing special. Inflight entertainment was awful. Provided headphones were of the earbud type really uncomfortable and wouldn't stay in the ears. Sound quality was horrible. Return leg was an unsuitable for long haul plane which was full after it stopped in Joburg. The meal on take off was delicious. The staff on the return leg were one of the most hard working I have encountered making up for the poor plane. However the breakfast was served cold and was uneatable. Same meal was served on the IST-LGW leg and we declined it. Security check at IST on the return leg was horrible. One South African woman bleeped while going through the gate and was the subject of what I consider rough and unnecessary treatment. Would consider flying again but only if the price was right.,Passive
"BUD-IST-YYZ-IST-BUD. BUD Ground services are horrible confusing and mean spirited towards the passenger. The inflight hard- ware experience is very good (seat toilets aircraft IFE etc.) but the human resources are like a lottery of low probabilities of meeting a winner or just someone to recall after a weekâ€¦BUD-IST-BUD sectors on A319 and B737 respectively. Only 2 rows assigned for business class and the seats were economy seats. However with only two passengers for the 12 seats available space was more than enough and one could lay down stretched out by lifting armrests. As for B737 there were old but true business class seats in a 2x2 configurations in 3 rows). Flights on time. Excellent service on board. Champagne at take-off. Special meal ordered almost a year in advance was given. Three more hot meals were presented and given by FA who were proud of their many options. Thus I had cold seafood platter as starter hot salmon as 1st maincourse and as 2nd main course: kofta 3rd main course: pasta and 4th rice with giant prawns. Cheese platter of high quality. Good advice on wines. IST-YYZ-IST on Boeing 777-300. Perfect hardware (inclusive WiFi) and excellent food. However the staff (FAs) has a lot to improve on - Language Socializing Read and understand passengers minds and needs. They need to avoid speaking Turkish to ""all"" passengers and could recruit a bulk of international staff to beef up Spanish Chinese Vietnamese Thai French Arab and â€¦English. The timing of service inputs need improvement. Sense of FA-humour is nil FA's avoidance of passengers is felt -â€“ one could sit on the entire flight without being offered more than 10% of what are available.",Passive
TLV-IST-YYZ on B777-300. Staff were friendly and helpful for the most part. Great In flight entertainment with large personal touchscreens USB and AC ports. Free Wi-Fi offered.

While planning a trip to Istanbul we decided on Turkish Airlines mainly due to low fares out of Houston. We booked economy and were a little concerned due to some negative reviews but we have no regrets but do have a few observations. Check in at Houston was fine we decided to upgrade to comfort class at check in there was no offer or signs we just asked. It cost us $350 each for one way but we are glad we did it. Roomy seats nice amenities and good food in comfort class. The in flight entertainment was not so great mostly older movies but we slept just fine. We had concerns about the temperature in flight and yes it was too warm. On our return from IST the check in was chaotic at best. Flight was fine food and amenities were about the same as comfort class so we are glad we did not pay to upgrade. Overall we would not hesitate to fly THY again.,Promoter
This was the first time I've flown Turkish airlines so I wasn't sure what to expect. The flight from Houston to Istanbul was great and flight attendants were fantastic. But the flight from Istanbul to Houston was bizarre. I had to show my ticket stub 4 times to prove I was in the correct area (not just me everyone had to show their ticket stub) and they placed stickers on unoccupied seats so they could tell if someone changed seats. Turkish Airlines apparently has a weird policy of not letting customers upgrade to premium seating when seats are available. They spend way too much time monitoring the empty seats. They really made my trip feel cheap and uncomfortable.,Passive
I read so many bad reviews of Turkish I was a bit sceptical when I boarded. The flights we took were round trip from Houston to Istanbul. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire experience. The plane was comfortable with adequate legroom in economy. Very good inflight entertainment system. Food was excellent. We especially liked that snacks/drinks during the mid-flight time (after first meal and before second) were all self service. Very convenient. My only complaint would be the lavatory got messy fast and never really felt clean. Flight out of Houston was one hour late out of Istanbul was right on time.,Promoter
Washington Dulles to Istanbul Business Class. I was re-routed from a cancelled flight onto this one and what a nice surprise it turned out to be. The flight arrived on time and the cabin crew were very polite. The service was excellent with on demand entertainment comfortable reclining seats to sleep in and a complimentary meal service. This was not at all like flying with the USA's airlines where the staff are usually brusque and rude and the service generally terrible. I very much recommend Turkish Airlines for long haul business class.,Promoter
IST-YYZ. Pretty much a good experience except that the overhead luggage storage was completely stuffed full as we boarded the aircraft. This created tension and stress as we did not want to store our belongings way down the aisle. We discovered that it was in fact the cabin crew that had plugged the overheads with their personal luggage and not even the crew from our cabin. I have flown with Turkish many times and I wish they would understand that little things like this do matter very much to the traveller.,Passive
19th April Nairobi to Istanbul. The cabin crew responded well and were kind I was also comforted by the Boeing sky interior in the Boeing 737-800. We took of on time and landed 15 minutes early. Return flight on 29th April was a bit hectic after we missed our return flight to Nairobi Turkish Airlines offered to help us and after clearing with them the main problem was our bags. They told us that our bags would be transferred from the lost and found desk directly to the aircraft. Would recommend.,Promoter
Travelled from Birmingham UK to Dhaka Bangladesh via Istanbul the on-going flight was ok. The return flight was not as pleasant the inflight entertainment system was not working. I asked the cabin crew if they could help but they were far too busy. Eventually after a long wait I was relocated to another seat similarly on the new seat the inflight entertainment system was not working. I had to make the entire journey (6 hours plus) with nothing to do. As a result I would not recommend Turkish Airlines.,Detractor
Houston to Delhi on 26th and it was quite impressive. Staff were attentive food was excellent and service excellent. I travel at least twice every year to India and this has been the best I have encountered.

I am looking forward to my next trip on 11/05 with a stop in Istanbul and heading to Chicago on 22nd.,Passive
JFK-IST-TLV and return. Flew with my family to Israel for Spring Break. This was my first time flying with Turkish Airlines and will not be my last. Flight attendants were very nice to me for all flights. Food was very good! Eggplant stuffed with minced beef was fantastic! JFK-IST and IST-JFK flights had good IFE with many music and movie selections to choose from. TLV-IST and IST-TLV flights had no inflight entertainment but this was only a two hour flight so I just slept. Seats were nice for economy. If only airlines in the US learned from airlines like Turkish. A very good experience.,Promoter
Flew MAN-MBA return in April. Both legs to and from MAN-IST were full. The service was great with a full meal and a good selection of drinks for economy. We had Exit row seats and had ample leg room. Full use of the entertainment system on these legs (good for 3.40 hour flight) and a decent selection of films however the games were not much to have. All fights on time and no luggage issues. Check-in staff in Manchester were very good and helpful and Mombassa staff polite friendly and obliging too. Long-haul flight on single aisle 737-900 service good though not quite the same high standard of the MAN-IST leg. On 7 hour flight to MBA only one full meal service thought they could of managed at least another drinks service many passengers went to the galley to get a drink. The return flight (4.00am) an average breakfast was served and sandwich snack before landing same entertainment system. This flight also included flight socks and shades which was a plus. FAs were friendly on the whole (male FAs more so then the female) though not always obliging and scarce once the meal service was over. Overall a really good experience and superior too many other European airlines would not hesitate one bit to flight them again in fact would prefer too - price wise very competitive and even cheaper too. Look forward to flying with them again. One tip - give yourself time to transfer at a busy Istanbul airport.,Promoter

Travelled ESB-IST-LHR and return 2/4/14 and 7/4/14. Both sets of flights and aircraft were satisfactory. Flight between Ankara and Istanbul is short so the crew have just enough time to give out the picnic baskets of food before descent commences. Sandwiches are served on the domestic flights which are ok but not a substitute for a proper meal. London flights were ok food was served within the first hour of the flight but then the cabin crew were almost non-existent for the remainder of the flight. Selection of food was not available to me on both international flights probably because I was sat in an exit row half way down the aircraft. It was beef or nothing. Connection between the two flights was stressful as navigating Ataturk airport customs is a long process. The most disappointing thing about the flights is the attitude of the cabin crew towards the safety rules. Many passengers on Turkish Airlines do not observe the seatbelt sign and will get out of their seats while the aircraft is taxiing to open overhead lockers. This occurred on all flights and the cabin crew were indifferent and didn't say a thing on all occasions. This is a very different attitude compared with other airlines. The command of English of the cabin crew and at times the pilots is quite poor also which is surprising for a growing international airline.,Passive
DUB-IST-PEK and return. Check-in slow at both DUB and PEK due to group travel. All four flights full. European sectors particularly good with very friendly smiling and welcoming onboard staff and food above average. IST-PEK outbound delayed by almost 3 hours with no explanation given. Service good staff efficient but indifferent on the long-haul flights with food below par on occasion particularly breakfast. Dinner on both long-haul sectors meals edible. Drinks plentiful with frequent top-ups. Entertainment excellent with plenty of choice of movies and programming. Will definitely use again but a little bit more required to maintain 4-star rating.,Passive
LAX-IST-BCN and return. Turkish continues to be a favorite with the finest catering I have encountered on any airline. On the intercontinental segments both the appetizer and the dessert are chosen from a cart laden (truly) with an incredible selection of options. The menu is extensive and provides something for every taste. While food in Business Class is generally good on every airline Turkish takes it to a new level and provides and experience worth anticipation. The crews are friendly and the seating is comfortable for long flights. All services were on time and the Istanbul Lounge is a wonderful place for relaxing between flights.,Promoter
TXL-IST-KRT return. With Lufthansa stopping its flights to KRT in January no major European airline flies there anymore. Thus flying from Europe the shortest route one has to take either Turkish Airlines or Egyptair. Since I had good experience with THY in the past I took them once again and have no complaints except for the 50 mins delay on the IST-KRT leg and the fact that they stopped serving alcohol on flights to sharia-law countries such as Sudan. The food was good and seats in the 738 were comfortable providing sufficient legroom even for a 4.10 hrs IST-KRT flight. Ataturk airport has been renovated since my last visit there and the wait for the connecting flights was quite pleasant.,Promoter
I fly every 3 weeks on Turkish. Having a good experience is like a game of roulette. Some aircraft's are excellent others very old and shabby. Economy class does what it says on the tin but Business class is generally below the standard of peers. However one thing is constant: the poor level of service. If anything goes wrong or if you have a special request just forget about it and remember this is an emerging airline. Cheap A to B in economy why not? But as a business traveler I cannot honestly recommend Turkish.,Detractor

I flew from JFK to Madrid and back from Rome to JFK. Outbound flight was not a good one with a delay resulting in missing our connecting flight to Madrid but it was mainly due to heavy snow and delay at JFK itself. However the returning flight was a real nightmare: We (family of 4) were not given the seats we reserved on the phone with the airline. They cancelled our flight out of Rome and replaced it with one leaving 4 hours later and arriving at IST 2 hours after our connecting flight to JFK left. The funny thing is that on the phone and at the Rome airport the reps I spoke to kept reassuring us that we will be able to catch our flight anyway. Of course they were not being truthful and we missed our flight and were put in a hotel. We had to pay Turkish entry visas. But the worst came when they made pre-arrangement with the hotel for our food. They did not give any voucher but pre-ordered a dish (same for everybody) consisting in a bowl of some kind of soup a fistful of rice with a piece of unidentified meat on top and no dring (not even water) allowed. They had no consideration for people's choice or diet preferences. You may get lucky but you may also dearly regret flying with them.,Detractor

I'm a frequent traveler hopping on planes every couple of weeks for U.S. domestic and European travel and my recent experience flying Turkish Airlines from Istanbul to JFK is the worst flight experience I have had. It started with not being able to contact the airline on the day of the flight to confirm the flight time on March 30th a day that Europe moved to daylight saving time but the Turkish government for some odd reason decided to delay the switch for twenty-four hours at the last minute. Next a surly person at the Turkish Airline check-in counter followed by a lengthy delay for takeoff due to the computer-automated baggage system being down. On the flight my travel companion and I were separated by the flight crew to accommodate a family that wanted to be seated together. We repeatedly told them we were traveling together he was moved to economy plus/business with plenty of seats around him but they refused to move me. So on an eleven-hour flight I ended up with no one to chat with. Finally the plane was full of toddlers and clearly the flight crew was having difficulty keeping the bathrooms clean and the cabin ended up smelling awful for the last 2 to 3 hours of the flight. On pulling out my laptop to do some work I discovered there was not enough room with the seat in front of me to actually open the laptop fully.,Detractor

This was my 4th trip with Turkish and will be my last. Coming back from Istanbul to Houston on April 6th all the flight attendants were missing in action for about 6-7 hours. They ran out of chicken by the time they got to row 31. No beverages were offered for hours and after ringing 3 times and getting nowhere I had to get up and go and look for someone.

TK1980 (14/3/2014) and 1985 (31/3/2014). Flights both outward and in were nightmares. For economy passengers the cabin seats food etc were fine. The cabin crew onboard were courteous enough. Onboard entertainment on outward flight was fine. The connecting flights were the ones that caused problems. On our outward journey there was only one hour allowed for us to get to the connecting flight from Istanbul to Dhaka. This one hour is too little. I am 71 years old and I was made to run behind the porter who was young and strong and was running and pushing my wife in a wheelchair through various check points to get us to the connecting flights on time. On the way back it was even worse. This time the time allowed for changeover at Istanbul was 1.5 hrs. The plane arrived late and after a very long wait the plane eventually stopped on one part of the runway. Passengers were bussed away and then the marathon began for them to get to the terminal for connecting flights. Same again running behind the porter pushing and running with my wife in the wheelchair. He managed to get us to the plane but just. There was no onboard entertainment on the flight from Dhaka to Istanbul.,Detractor

Johannesburg to Istanbul on 3rd April 2014 flight TK 41. The flight was full yet flight attendants graciously attended to each passenger. They smiled and were extremely polite which is something that seems to be lacking across a number of airlines. Aircraft was very clean in great condition and the interior - in turquoise colour had a calming Mediterranean feeling to it. We were offered Turkish delights and dried fruit. Dinner followed it was sumptuous served with a variety of wines and other drinks. It was a pleasant 8 hour flight I was comfortable throughout. Toilets were spacious and clean. Throughout the flight the attendants were always nearby.,Promoter
Chose the airline due to recommendation and price. Went from Gatwick to Kuala Lumpur via Istanbul experienced a long delay on the outward leg at Istanbul but otherwise flights were on time. Staff were very attentive and the food was excellent. When transferring flights at Istanbul on the return leg queues were dreadful requiring us to go through security again - this needs to be sorted out! However would certainly use them again as overall the level of service was extremely high.,Promoter
BHX-BKK March 24th. Birmingham to Istanbul all OK. Istanbul to BKK awful time to get a drink 1.5 hours time to dinner nearly 3 hours despite them setting the table within 20 minutes of take off. Bar service in view at front of business class showed their lack of attention to detail was asked 3 times what red wine I wanted and had to point at the menu don't think the hostess new difference between white and red as she was looking at all labels! When dinner was served it was very late so I turned it down not asked if I wanted breakfast and was not offered it on waking up. Come on Turkish you tell a good story but in reality. Price was very good which is why I tried Turkish lets see what return from Beijing brings on 10th.,Detractor
I think the flight from Houston to Istanbul for one leg of the trip. Another leg from Istanbul to Rome. Another leg Rome to Istanbul back to Houston and I was satisfied with the flight.

Economy LGW-CPT via IST on 31 March. New 737-900ER plane to IST. Very comfortable spacious with plenty of leg room. Service good special meal arrived as ordered and pleasant. Easy transfer at IST despite being bussed to terminal. Boarding on CPT flight chaotic - started before doors to ramp open so standing around a long time. Flight very full - seats less comfortable than the 737 (older 330) and less leg room. Staff particularly good on this flight - attentive special meal again available for refreshments throughout the flight. Good communication from crew to passengers. Well recommended if you can get a good price to compensate for longer journey time between UK and SA.,Promoter
We boarded a flight from Edin to Istanbul on 23/3/14. The cabin was rather small (seating of 2 and 3) and the air- conditioning was rather warm! Seats can be rather cramped if you are on the plus size. No negative comments about the food though. However Istanbul airport was chaotic. Going through passport control took us a good one hour. The next leg of our flight was Istanbul -Kuala Lumpur on a much bigger plane. Again the food was satisfactory. Service was ok and inflight entertainment featured some of the latest movies. Nevertheless the cabin temperature was a bit warm. We got a good deal on the tickets (1900 pounds for 5 pax) so I guess I shouldn't complain much.,Passive
All 4 flights reasonably good (Vienna-Male and back via Istanbul) however mostly unfriendly crew and delays of 2 of 4 flights. The delay as such was not too bad but the frustrating thing was that the pilots gave no information at all to the passengers. Imagine a delay of 1 hour and you sit in the plane and get no information about reason/extent of delay despite begging flight attendants for information. Pilots just did not care about passengers hope it is not the culture of Turkish Airlines. And there are two extremes: no announcements with regard to flight delay but otherwise so many announcements of useless information that passengers really got irritated. I'm sure Turkish Airlines is quite high in the ratio of announcement time versus flying time. Would be good if they reduce the announcement to the extent of other airlines. Please announce/talk less to passengers!,Detractor
IST-KTM. Flight was delayed 2.5 hours. No staff at the gate to provide information. Onboard the aircraft personal reading lights were either on and flight attendants were not able to switch them off or vv. IFE was only showing the flight information. The AVOD system was working for half an hour only then it crashed and flight attendants neither attempted to reset it nor was any announcement made regarding this. After landing in KTM a single panel with three oxygen masks dropped down the row in front of me. On the bright side: Food was excellent.,Detractor
I flew in business class from Zurich to Johannesburg and back via Istanbul with Turkish Airlines. Their business class product for short haul was by far the best business class I have experienced in Europe. The crew were friendly and efficient the seat pitch was good and the food was absolutely great. The lounge in Istanbul is one of the nicest business class lounges I have been in. The long-haul sector to Johannesburg and back was also great. OK the seat and the inflight entertainment and not the most modern but they were well within acceptable bounds. Once again flight crews were friendly and efficient. No problems at any time with ground services. No delays and bags all delivered promptly and in good shape.,Promoter
IST-JIB with return. Both sectors brand new A321 with very good IFE. Food always above standards and plenty of soft drinks (no spirits on these flights). Cabin crew very attentive. The outbound leg arrived 30 minutes early. However the return had a delay of 30 minutes and I had a connection flight to catch (1h 30 min). This is the biggest issue with THY. Ground handling in IST. Although they were informed they did nothing. Long bus ride and then the chaotic security control of IST airport. The only reason that I didn't miss the next flight was a 20 minute delay. As far as it goes for value for money.,Promoter
My husband I are seasoned travellers. We travelled to Kathmandu from the UK via Birmingham and back again with a 3 day stop over in Istanbul. On our journey back we missed our flight due to a faulty flight display system which did not show that the plane was boarding and a public announcement system which did not announce the flight. The staff on the ground were rude discourteous and unhelpful. It took the airport staff to help us. Much needs to be done to improve services.,Detractor
I flew TK1939 (IST-BRU) in an Airbus 321. I had forgotten how pleasant flying economy class could be after all those hated Ryanair flights. Every seat has a personal screen with loads of movies to chose from. Fortunately the 3 hour flight gave me enough time to watch a full movie. Food was delicious. They even brought a menu with a choice of two plates. Wine was free. There even was a cook (complete with a cook hat). I know -it's just a flight attendant dressed differently but I bought it. Being a Gold elite member at Star Alliance I had access to the Turkish Airlines lounge before the flight. Truly wonderful. Spacious a great buffet and even a golf simulator to kill time. From now on I will use Turkish Airlines for all my flights to Asia avoiding Lufthansa and Frankfurt or Munich!,Promoter
I flew on flight #8 from IAD to IST and was quite impressed food was very good entertainment could be better but I guess it is enough to get by. Service is good however you might encounter a little attitude at times from the flight attendants. The departure back to IAD on flight #7 was also quite nice with some attitude problems from some flight attendants. Departure from IST is a bit disorganised you have to go trough a lot of security to board that flight to DC in Istanbul. I would fly this way again to go to Europe my final destination was Zurich Switzerland and those flights were great and on time.,Promoter
Dubai to Barcelona via Istanbul (Flight TK 0761 and TK1853 IST - Barcelona) on 15th March 2014. Flight delayed from Dubai however we arrived 50 minutes prior to departure of Barcelona flight.

DXB-IST 24th Jan TK 0761. IST-HBE 25th Jan TK 0696. I was lured to this airline by their extensive advertising I wish they saved the costs of advertising to improve their equipment and services. I paid for business class and I didn't even get anything near decent economy standard. The plane was old. The seats were in a very bad state. Boarding was chaotic. The second flight was on 25th Jan IST-HBE. Although I paid for a business class seat all I got was an economy seat at the front of the plane.,Detractor

I am back from my recent trip to Nepal and I have to say this has been the worst trip I had taken so far. Return trip from Kathmandu to Istanbul was delayed 6 hours thereby missing my connecting flight to USA. They re-routed me through Canada the next day and my baggage was left in Istanbul. Turkish ground staff were inefficient most do not seem to know what they were doing and keep you waiting for hours.,Detractor
BCN-IST-LJU in economy 7 March 2014. One of the better flights on Turkish. What bothers me is the inconstancy of service staff and maintenance of flight. 1 good flight out of 10. I always select a seat when booking but somehow when I check in TK always change the seat. As a Gold member I am not able to select exit rows either not even at online check-in. On both flights I was comfortable however having an aisle seat the middle sear next to me was empty the cabin was not hot at this time and the service was rather good. We were however delayed out of IST for more than 20 mins. but arrived 5 mins late to LJU. I will not fly Turkish for another year let's see if they get better.,Passive
London-Istanbul-Beijing Economy class. I have to say this is the best economy class I have experienced. For both segments Turkish delights are served immediately after takeoff the food is completely at different classes against other European airlines juice was freshly squeeze orange juice. For the long haul flight we were given slippers ear phones toothbrush and toothpaste and so on which you do not expect in economy class. However the drawback is the geography of Turkey has made the flight much longer and the staff in the Istanbul airport are absolute nightmare although they are not the faults of the airline. However I have worries about passenger behaviour once the aircraft has touched down people are standing up and collecting their luggage from the overhead storage this is the case whether the aircraft is either still on or just leaving the main landing ways. I feel sorry for the cabin crews as there are just so many people and there are little things the crews could do about it.,Promoter
LGW to CPT - 27/28 February in Economy. Both planes very full. Easy boarding in London - less so in Istanbul where it was necessary to board a coach to go to the plane. Seats on both were comfortable and inflight entertainment good. Food excellent - special meal provided as requested. Staff very helpful on board and good amenity kit. Highly recommended especially if you can get a promotional fare. Security check on transfer at Istanbul simplified and no lines.,Promoter
Copenhagen-Istanbul-Kathmandu on 18th February and back on 24th and that was not a good experience. On the flight from Istanbul to Kathmandu the plane was old and shabby with very little space the lights at the seats did not work so the light was on in the cabin all night there were no screens in front of the seats and no entertainment not even information on the flight on the small communal screens. Nobody served water or anything during the night dinner was OK but meagre and as a vegetarian I got only half the food of those who had ordered meat. I asked for more but the staff member never came back with it. The flight could not land in Kathmandu due to fog. We were 5 hours late with an extra landing in New Delhi with no food or drink and arrived 5 hours late with no offer of compensation. On the way back again more than 5 hours delay without information as to why as we arrived in Istanbul it took ages to get tickets for a meal in the airport and when we got them we could only use them in the fast food restaurants in the food court and had to pay ourselves if we wanted to sit in a decent place. All together not to be recommended - and on top of it all the staff was not very friendly and informative.,Detractor
27 Feb TK 211 Antalya-Moscow economy. Aircraft was old 320 at the airport before departure no proper explanation given for almost one hour delay - apparently caused by malfunctioning of emergency door.

Staff not attentive to passengers especially for a business level flight. Baggage was last out even being tagged priority on first leg the return flight baggage was lost.

Over priced as well usually double the fare for a 1 stop business flight compared to other airlines like British KLM or Lufthansa.,Detractor
HEL-IST-BOM return on A320 B777 and A321. Last trip on TK was few years back and since many fellow travellers on this forum have suggested TK to be inconsistent nowadays we didn't expect anything really. TK turned out to be very good on all four sectors: all flights on time or ahead of schedule all aircraft quite new with great legroom and good IFE that had many interesting options. Moreover the hot meals by DO&CO were of high quality compared to any big European competitor - I still prefer proper food on flights over 3 hrs instead of a sandwich if a meal is served. Human interaction is always a matter of personal taste: for us the cabin crews on these full flights were perfectly fine with good command of English - plus many smiles all the way. All in all TK was very comfortable and great value really.,Promoter
We chose the airline for the good price they have in Business Class and also for the fantastic lounge in Istanbul. The hard product on long distance planes are great but the 737 and 320 that we flew ARN-IST with is just normal economy seats with blocked middle seat. The food is good but the service level is low. Priority boarding is a big no. Everyone is let onboard straight away. The Cabin Crew hardly says hello as you enter the aircraft and dinner service is slow. A smile is very unusual on Turkish. So pay for a good seat (on long distance flights) ok food onboard and a good lounge in Istanbul. Service level is very low. Also if you book early you can get a really good price even in Business class.,Passive
Flight from CPT-IST-CPH. Turkish airlines has a top of the range product (if one were to exclude their customer service). Their planes are very up to date modern interior fantastic food great lie flat seats and generous sized IFE with a wide selection of films. The CIP lounge in IST was also very very good! Customer service has ample room for improvement. Perhaps its a cultural thing but I didn't find the cabin crew nor the staff in the lounge particularly forthcoming. In fact they were all quite arrogant individuals which appeared to hate their jobs. Nevertheless I will fly with them again - just don't be expected to be treated like royalty.,Promoter
TK 1637 IST-MUC. Going back home from Iran I had to change planes in IST. This was a very bad experience you had to go through security control and I had only a limited time for connection. It was overcrowded and disorganized. We started with delays because of disorganization. They checked whether everybody had a visa or permission to go to a Schengen country. Why did they not check it when getting the boarding pass. Entering the plane very unfriendly crew. They served everything without smiles not speaking English? Like always theoretically the choice of two meals but on reaching row # 18 there was no longer a choice. Only one kind of meal left. Happily it was the meal of my choice.,Detractor
Flew JFK-BOM and return with stopover in IST on my way back. First served a little Turkish Delight (Lokum) which was quite nice. This was followed by drinks and meal. JFK-IST served 2 meals and IST-BOM had one. Leg room for economy was pretty much what I expected. IFE was quite good. New movies shows and free WIFI which was of course slow but worked. They also have USB media so you could just snap your flash drive and it will play the songs / media on it. I have travelled on Cathay Qatar and Emirates and while they do have the USB slot it wouldn't play media but this one did. Staff were courteous and polite. The IST-JFK sector had many vacant seats in Comfort class but they wanted 260 Euros which I didn't got for. Paid less than $900 for the round trip with the stopover so it was a good value.,Passive
Istanbul - Munich - Istanbul 10 January 2014. A very comfortable and enjoyable flight both in Business Class. The staff were friendly and helpful. The planes were both Airbus A321.

HAM-IST-AYT-IST-HAM: Once onboard we were greeted by courteous staff. Before takeoff they served Turkish Delight in economy class which is something never to be seen on any other European airlines. They even arranged my vegetarian meal from business class as it was not loaded. TK serves fresh orange juice and lemonade which is perhaps the best drink I have had on onboard! Meals are always tasty and crew are friendly and helpful although I have to say that Chef-onboard service is absolutely useless. Chef did not even know what the vegetarian meal was on TK flights but thanks to the crew who got me something to eat although it came an hour after the service. The legspace is acceptable and much better than Air Berlin and Lufthansa though one of their aircraft's was so old that I could hold the seat cushion. All in all it was a pleasant experience.

I flew with Turkish in January in C-Class Vienna-Istanbul-Bangkok and Singapore-Istanbul-Vienna. Its true that they offer good amounts of food but the quality was poor on all these sectors. Completely tasteless meals served by flight attendants that did not smile at all and did not understand English. The cabins of the long sectors IST- BKK and SIN-IST were also quite dirty. The most disappointing thing was that the crews on all the sectors were not very friendly. Austrian Airlines also have Do&Co as their caterer but between Austrian and Turkish there is a big difference.,Detractor
Flew from Vilnius to Dubai. Plane from Vilnius to Istanbul was great and comfortable yet got very old A330 from Istanbul to Dubai. Service is great price is ok too. Yet I wish they would make at least a few seats for people taller then 180cm. I'm 189cm and I absolutely hate Airbus seats as their head rest is pointing at my shoulders.

JNB-IST-WAW 13 and 14th Feb. Flights on time. Metal was A330 and A321 respectively. The long haul was excellent with many food and drink choices. Wines from 4-5 continents ranging from rose champagne red and whites selected from within a wide range just to my taste. FA attendants were frequent and respectful. IFE maybe the best I've seen and easy to operate. Huge monitors. Bed not fully lie flat so I actually turned around and laid my head on the stool and slept better with my legs in slight upward position. Night-kit given was boring and superfluous. Check-in at transit in JNB only possible 3 hours prior to departure. However was allowed through security without boarding cards as to kill time in the SAA-lounges. When the check in lady eventually appeared at transit she was professional and kind and managed even to trace my luggage and give it an additional (needed) label so I could transfer it throughout. The corresponding luggage receipt was smoothly given to me as I entered the stairs boarding the aircraft. The lounge in IST was extended with a huge under-deck 3 days ago and is a world-class positive experience in design space beauty and service provided. IST-WAW on Airbus 321-200. Not business class seat but ordinary economy with tabled middle seat to increase space in the 3x3 configuration. IFE on small ceiling monitors were useless. Staff were alert and kind. As usual for TK one was dressed up pretending to be a cook despite we were only 4 pax in business out of 12 possible. Food very good varied and wide options inc. of individual cheese plates deserts etc. Even champagne was offered on this European flight of a duration of only 2+ hours.,Promoter
HEL-IST-TLV 19 Feb. Fog in IST kept us delayed in HEL for 3 hours. Updates from gate agents left much to be desired. 45 minutes circling the foggy airport not a nice feeling but eventually landed safely. Next flight to TLV delayed 4 hours. No gate personnel present until boarding. No amenities offered. HEL-IST A319 with no IFE at all. Crew friendly and nice meal/bar service. Generous with alcohol. IST-TLV A321 with IFE at every seat. Leg room a disaster compared to other TK a/c. Again all female crew friendly nice food. I also noticed that on all 4 flights the aircraft's were never air-conditioned. It meant sitting in a very warm stuffy and crowded plane until they were ready to go. Not a very welcoming environment. All in all good service. Will fly again.,Promoter
AMS-IST: I was on the wing. This section has to do with 1 less FA than in the back. My warm meal arrived cold. KIX-IST: Like on the outbound flight a sense of disorganization during 1st meal service. One FA was running back and forth. Good on-time performance.,Passive
TLV-IST-HEL. TLV to IST B737-800 great leg room leather seats no personal IFE. The crew were nice handed out heart shaped chocolates for Valentines Day. They managed to serve breakfast on this short flight and a bar service. The only bad remark cabin very hot during boarding terrible welcome. It got better as we took off. Remote parking in IST bussed to terminal. Security much quicker than expected. Departure area crowded and stuffy as usual. Again boarded A321 steaming hot. This time legroom was atrocious could not move or eat? The B737-800 felt like business class compared to this torture. Crew friendly and hard working full hot meal service wine beer and alcohol were free. This time personal IFE. Product seems inconsistent. All in all a positive experience.,Promoter

IST-EZE GRU-IST Economy. I am a frequent flyer with TK (Elite) and there are many things I like about TK but the biggest problem of this airline is consistency. Some flights are excellent while others are just a horrible experience. This happened with my flights to EZE and back from GRU. The plane on both legs was awful. Under each seat there is a big metal box which makes it unbearable in combination with the tight legroom. Overall the plane seemed old and not taken care of. It had not been cleaned properly before departure. The staff were not attentive forgetting my requests. On the return flight there was no menu no hot towel no fresh orange juice. The temperature during the flight - freezing. The lounge in GRU is a joke. The good TAM lounge is closed at night and they use the Smiles lounge which is simply not acceptable. Ground handling poor - my priority has not been recognized at baggage delivery and for the return flight the check in staff didn't attach the priority label at all. All in all if I only took this one flight and judged TK based on this experience I would definitely not recommend this airline.,Detractor
9th Feb TK70. We purchased our tickets from London to Istanbul and then from Istanbul on to Hong Kong almost as soon as they were released 11 months before we were due to travel. Perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point. We didn't worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early. This turned out to be a naive assumption! When we attempted to check in online which was more than 36 hours before the Istanbul to Hong Kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin. Our pleas to the Turkish airlines office in London the check in desk at Gatwick and the transfer desk at Istanbul were all to no avail. This completely ruined the flight for me whilst I respect that the airline couldn't bump someone from a pre booked seat we should have been sat together by default at point of booking.,Detractor

No other European carrier serves this amount of meals on intraeuropean flights and service about the same on intercontinental. As a regular flyer on THY in recent years I would recommend changing the meals a little - on all 4 flights food was the same as before always delicious but perhaps a little tired compared to some years ago. Beverage service excellent and although staff of THY are not very smiley they were effective. Inflight entertainment good with good selection of movies both older and recently published. Transfer in IST chaotic on way out very smooth on return flight. Again I can recommend THY for both service costs and extensive route network.,Promoter

DHK-IST then IST-JFK. This was my first time with Turkish airline. Cabin staff were rude. On my first leg I ordered a glass of water twice but it never came I had to walk to the galley to get my glass of water. The food was served after 1 hour. It was an 8.5 hrs flight so me and my wife slept a bit after the meal was done. I took beef biriyani and my wife took grilled chicken. The chicken was really tasty unfortunately I choose the wrong meal. Then before landing we were served a sandwich which was good. On our 2nd leg IST to JFK (10 hrs 30 mins) it was an early morning flight which was supposed to take off at 7.30 but got delayed 45 minutes. First meal (scrambled egg with mushroom) was served immediately after take off which was tasty but the cabin crews were again disappointing. Again I ordered a cocktail but it didn't come the first time I asked for it. I would recommend this flight as its cheap.,Passive
Flew from Manchester to Dhaka (14th January) return Dhaka to London (11th January). Completely mixed bag experience when comparing the outbound and return journeys. The outbound was 10 out 10 due to punctuality professionalism amenities etc. I took advantage of the free Istanbul Tour offered by the Turkish Airlines. For the return leg the flight was delayed by 7.5 hours due to foggy conditions at Dhaka which obviously is not Turkish's fault. I was put on a different connecting flight to London which was supposed to depart within 1 hour of the arrival of the Dhaka flight to Istanbul. However the flight took 8.5 hours instead of 7 hours which meant that I missed the London flight. But what made this experience worse is the lack of in-flight entertainment system on this 8.5 hour flight. If Turkish is to compete with the other Airlines (Emirates Qatar Etihad) flying to Dhaka it has to take the Istanbul-Dhaka-Istanbul route seriously and ensure consistency across the flights.,Passive
LHR-IST-SCQ via BIO. I pre-reserved seats which were not respected even being Elite+ passenger on TK. Check in at LHR was very regular not giving a decent service. I was not advised about the seats and lounge options. Flight LHR-IST departed on time and was full. Fight was so hot! A321 was dirty and old. The cabin crew served the meal and drinks and disappeared for the entire flight. My headphones stopped working in the middle of the movie and even changing them did not help. Staff did not do anything to help. My next flight to Santiago via Bilbao was as bad as the first one. No movie available. Only one service available during 6 hrs of the flight. The last leg BIO- SCQ did not have any service. All in all not a good experience and for the price paid I would never repeat!,Detractor
NRT - Istanbul - Barcelona. Plenty of food and snacks on the long haul flight - I love how they give out Turkish Delights just after take off and a meal menu on all flights. The only complaint was the friendliness of the crew who always looked grumpy and a few were falling asleep at their crew seats during taking off and landing on both sectors. Once they completed their meal service they disappeared and were chatting non stop at the back of the plane with other crew. Other than this a good 2 sectors with TK.,Passive
Geneva - Istanbul TK1918 19 Dec 2013. Istanbul - Dhaka 19 Dec 2013 TK0712. Dhaka - Istanbul 9 Jan 2014. Istanbul - Geneva 10 Jan 2014. No inflight entertainment on flight from Istanbul to Dhaka or from Dhaka to Istanbul. On January 9 flight from Dhaka to Istanbul was delayed 7 hours due to fog. When the flight finally took off on 9 Jan flight time from Dhaka to Istanbul (non-stop) was 8.5 hours due a ridiculously old plane being used. I was informed in Dhaka on 9 Jan that I would miss my connecting flight to Geneva and would have to travel the next morning and was thus issued a boarding pass for the next day. When we arrived in Istanbul no instructions were given by the cabin crew leaving passengers to figure things out on their own. It took another 2.5 hours for ground staff to issue us hotel vouchers. Some toilets were non-functional on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka on 19 December. All crew members on the flight from Istanbul to Dhaka and back appeared to be Turkish and spoke very basic English. Plus points: Staff of Turkish airlines in Dhaka were most professional and courteous and did their best to attend to the needs of passengers. Food was decent. Overall - a very lousy experience. There is a major difference in the quality of service (old planes no in-flight entertainment rude/unprofessional service) on the flight to/from Dhaka-Istanbul compared to flights to/from Istanbul-Geneva.,Detractor

"JFK-Istanbul-Bangkok. While the crew were not overwhelmingly friendly they did their jobs efficiently and mostly with smiles. What sets Turkish Airlines apart besides their phenomenal lounge at the Istanbul Airport is the quality and quantity of the food that they serve on board. Whereas on most other airlines you get a choice of perhaps 3 different appetizers to choose from on Turkish Airlines they have a whole trolley filled with different Turkish appetizers from you to select. You can try as many as you want. The same logic holds true for desserts. You had perhaps 10 different options to choose from. The seats on both flights were not of the ""lie flat"" variety but were comfortable nonetheless. My only true complaint dealt with the cabin temperature. The crew kept the temperature fairly warm on both flights. I did ask one of the attendants to lower the temperature on the flight to Istanbul which she did. But in about an hour or two later the temperature was warm again. Offerings in the amenity kits provided were generous and the cabins and rest rooms were kept fairly clean throughout both flights. Lastly it really is a bit comical to see one or two of the flight attendants dressed up as chefs given that none of the food is prepared on board.",Promoter
TK 713 Dhaka - Istanbul Dec 13 2013 and TK 712 Istanbul - Dhaka Jan 9 2014. The airline is turning from slight above average to a complete disaster on their Dhaka bound flights. Now they are using their oldest A330-203 with no inflight entertainment at all. Seats are sometimes broken. Even the last resort of comfort the reading lights are not working or wrongly wired and therefore useless or really annoying. FAs are trying to cope with it but you can see that it even annoys them to work on a plane like this. They will even wake you up in the middle of the night to serve breakfast when everybody was sleeping. When I got shook awake despite having a sleeping mask on and questioned them they said it is normal for them to serve at this time as it was morning in Istanbul (5 hours away). Dhaka is not an easy destination but Turkish is doing everything to make it the worst for the average passenger. In winter when there is morning fog in Dhaka Turkish is the only carrier that does not dare to change their flight schedule like Emirates or Qatar but prefers to have their flights delayed by 5 hours without prior notification. It had now happened 3 times travelling from Dhaka or Istanbul. Only positive thing is the quality of the food which is usually good and tasty and drinks policy. Nevertheless this was my last flight with them after I was a loyal traveller due to affordable price.,Detractor
BKK-SGN. Very disappointed upon a first good impression that did not last: Aircraft 777-300 were old and worn. Staff pretend to be kind but were just assuming they could speak English. Basically no food on board and a very very poor cold sandwiched was made from remnants from the previous leg flown. Horrible. The 2 staff dressed as cooks were a joke: apart from clothes not clean they were just pretending and no foods were ever cooked or made for the flight. Could not get additional food. They told me that the cheese was spoiled by heat from the previous trip. An FA agreed to offer me anyway but never came to me again. The mayonnaise in the sandwich were not good and too much. After hard negotiations got a glass of champagne but no info of provenance. Menu cards were wishful thinking. Seats worn and torn arranged in herring pattern poorly arranged and most provided no view. No earphones provided. No travel kit no magazines no papers nothing of anything! Seat pockets were empty except for air-sick bags and safety/emergency info card. Staff kept away from cabin as they had nothing to offer. At least they admitted that they had ran short of supplies. We were then forced seated as they announced we were to land soon. That gave them excuse for further denials of drinks and snacks and food. I was allowed to try their ancient 1st class and was impressed by the very old design and spacious cabin with 4 windows at a seat. The cabin was closed for service however as only business class is sold. Give only score 3 out of 10: two for being on time and one for an FA for being honest enough to admit food crises on board.,Detractor
KTM-IST-LHR 28/12/2013. A330-300 flight from KTM was delayed around 5 hours. Not much information given apart from aircraft was circling above probably due to fog but other flights although smaller jets landed up to 2 hours earlier. On board aircraft had no personal screens and on take off the Captain announced there would be no IFE with no reason given. Transit at IST should have been 6 hours but due to the delay we had a 1 hour transfer so a rush to the departure gate. Flight to LHR arrived a half hour early but checked in baggage was left in IST. This was delivered on the next flight and delivered by courier the next day.,Passive
On Jan 17th we went from DXB to IST. This flight was awful. Normally they have quite a lot space in economy class but not in this Boeing we really had to squeeze ourselves between the seat rows! Also they had no control over the hand luggage. Passengers came with really large bags and cases which that were not at all suitable to be stored in the cabin. When the lockers were full some passengers started arguing. This was chaos! Until this point we had always been satisfied with THY but this time we were disappointed. The connecting flight from IST to LEJ as well as the onward flights some days ago were much better.,Detractor
Flight from MUC to IST. We left on time but when we reached IST we had to wait about 25 mins on the airfield. The crew were very unfriendly without saying 'hello' on entering the plane. Shortly after take off we got Turkish Delights then nothing more for 1.5 hrs. According to the menu we had the choice of two meals but when staff arrived at my row there was no choice. The meal was cold drinks and meal served together.,Detractor
LHR-IST-LHR over the Christmas - We use this airline regularly as they offer a good choice of flights from London with convenient departure times and have always been impressed with the quality of inflight service. B777-300 in both directions - aircraft was very clean and looked reasonably new. Very tasty meals were served in both directions and the Turkish Delight shortly after take-off is a nice touch. Good choice of drinks offered with the meal although it's true to say that they don't regularly pass through the cabin with the drinks trolley (to be honest there aren't many airlines that do these days - especially in economy) all you have to do is ask and they will serve you with a smile! The AVOD offered a good choice of TV and movies - the 4h flight passed very quickly. It's worth remembering however that some of the flights from London use smaller B737 or A320 family aircraft and may not have personal TVs in economy. The 11.40 and 16.10 flights from LHR generally use A330s / 777s. We have flown on smaller planes and the service is fine but not quite as much legroom as on the 777. Overall the flights were very comfortable with good in-flight service and compare favourably with many Western European airlines that I have flown on and have no hesitation in recommending them.,Promoter
LHR-IST round trip. I decided to choose schedule based on flying on the 777-300 (Jet Airways lease). Chose row 33 out 31 back. Complimentary drinks served quickly followed by offer of a Turkish delight and then a full meal service. Choice of chicken or beef dish same on return journey but still good quality for an economy flight. Cabin crew efficient not really service with a smile however. Seat back on demand films games etc. to pass the time. Both flights spot on time with bags off quickly.,Passive
IST-IKA 28th Dec 2013. I arrived from MUC going to IKA. Finally one hour delayed we entered the plane. Crew were very unfriendly without taking any notice of us. Shortly after take-off we got Turkish delights. Then it took a very long time before we got our meal. According to the menu you had the choice of two meals but when they reached my row no choice and a very cold meal. On the A321 you had theoretically inflight entertainment. The menu of the display was in Turkish English German French Arabic but only the menu. The movies etc. were only in Turkish. Summary: Delayed bad service cold meals unfriendly staff chaotic situation at the airport in Istanbul.,Detractor

Flew Turkish Airlines for the first time in December Business Class from Dhaka to Vienna return Paris to Dhaka. We were disappointed in a number of things.

The rap highlight however was the Istanbul lounge which must be amongst the best in the world. Fabulous food and services.,Passive
On 5th Jan 2014 flew Business class from Manchester to Bangkok via Istanbul. The trip was disappointing in that we flew on different planes than we were advised when booking the flight from Manchester to Istanbul was supposed to be on a 737-900 but was in fact on an old 321 and the flight from Istanbul to Bangkok was supposed to be on a 777 but in fact was on an old 340. However what was good about the flights was the excellent service of the cabin crews and the quality of food and beverage both of which were of the highest order and could not be faulted.,Passive

18/12/2013 Luxembourg-Istanbul TK1354. 19/12/2013 Istanbul-Jakarta TK66. 4/1/2014 Kuala Lumpur-Istanbul TK61. 5/1/2014 Istanbul-Luxembourg TK1353. Staff on various flights were impolite to even rude. A vegetarian meal was ordered and served but turned out to contain meat. After enquiring they simply took back the meal and served a new one without saying a single word. No apology - nothing. Other questions were answered with grimaces only not words. Safety instructions from staff before landing sound more like army orders. The media box in their A340 takes half of the foot space absolutely inconvenient on long distance. The inflight entertainment doesn't contain new releases only old movies. The schedule as per magazine doesn't comply with the entertainment system. Furthermore very limited language options on some flights only. The food was very good on one flight average on 2 and un-enjoyable on the 4th flight. Journey time was quite long. Website looks antiquated not possible to order special meal only by phone. Online check-in not possible for some origins but they tell you only after all data like passport number date of birth has been entered already. The transfer in their Istanbul hub is horrible. One has to queue for transfer safety check for hours. All in all the second worst airline I have flown with.,Detractor
Flew GVA-IST-AUH. Seats were dirty and could hardly be reclined footrest is a joke. On both legs staff rushed through the meal to the point where my husband had to physically hold on to his tray (IST-AUH). Staff not very friendly no greeting during boarding and an unapproachable attitude during the flights seats in front of us were used by cabin crew to sleep during the flight between IST-AUH. Entertainment system was poor compared to what other airlines have to offer. On both flights the toilet was smelly and did not feel clean. Not looking forward to our return flights nor the changing of planes in Istanbul we will avoid them in the future.,Detractor
Bangkok to Istanbul. The inbound flight was the opposite of the outbound. There were people going up and down the aisles constantly prior to take off apparently dealing with this and that. Once aloft the service was ok but there was some disorganisation,Passive
"Istanbul to Bangkok. Functional yet friendly service esp. from ""the chef"". Excellent meals this really helped the score. Everything worked though the 340's seat was not so good for a long flight (see my seat review). Only just ""good value"" here because of the seat.",Promoter
Although seats are very good there are severe limitations: Istanbul Airport offers no extra tracks for Business class passengers which means that you have to line up with all the others in the middle of the night/early in the morning (usually) to pass the overcrowded security checks. There is a fast track lane but it was always closed when I needed to pass it (4 times in the past 2 months). Istanbul airport is deplorable not coping with the rapid expansion of TK. This means that your expensive Business class experiences finds a rather unpleasant middle piece. Even more disturbing is the very wrong catering service concept and staff quality. Usually one pays for an expensive business class seat to find rest and piece and some sleep. TK assumes that you are in it for the culinary experience and serve food regardless of the flying time thus limiting the rest time severely. For instance while flying from Istanbul to Cape Town TK started serving dinner at midnight for over 3 hours. Then they wake you up 2 hours before landing to serve breakfast. Even worse is that the crew is serving and removing the food very noisily moving plates glasses etc for hours. The 11 hours flight to Cape Town thus had only 3 hours of quite sleeping time. Worst affected are the first and last rows of the business class being close to the pantry. Another bad example was the flight from Istanbul to Doha: here same procedure: although guests wanted to sleep right after the take-off (midnight again). Food was served almost the entire flight (4 hours). Noise was unbearable as the pantry did not even had a shielding curtain. Besides the fact that the food is nothing special the quality of the crews is very heterogeneous. During the flight to Doha the chief cabin attendant was reading the newspaper drank tea in front of the business class passengers (no curtain) and was observing leisurely the work of his subordinates. The staff chats constantly with each other and although there are more than enough attendants on board it is not possible to place a successful request as the chain of command is long and unclear responsibilities seem to exist.,Detractor
Extremely pleasant flight. Despite all weather issues our flight took off and landed on time in Toronto. In- flight free wi-fi is definitely the best. The meals were so tasty and fresh.

I have nothing but praise for this great airline. Meals provided and drinks included. They have always left on time. They are great value for money.

Staff didn't want to be on the plane it was so bad. I would like to try Turkish Airlines again when I travel in September this year - how do I know whether I get a good plane or a bad one.

DUS-IST-KUL and return in Economy. DUS-IST and IST-DUS by A320/321. Very crowded and the cabin crew didn't bring discipline into boarding deboarding and inflight behavior. All natural chaos with people standing/talking while fasten seatbelt-sign was shown passengers with much more than 1 piece of (bulky) hand luggage children without seats pax standing up just after touching the runway - nobody seems to care.

PTV's on A321 ok but on A320 not at all not even on the roof! Finally we had to wait about 4 hours both inbound and outbound in a chaotic transit in Istanbul with not even one chair to sit on.

Transfer in IST was horrific - poor signs and the transit for VIP passengers is not highlighted so easy to miss. Miles of walking and it looked like a building site. The lounge was simply overcrowded and staff at reception had an ""I don't care attitude"". Onward flight boarded early no separate line for business class and departed on time.

Business class LGW-IST-BKK / BKK-IST-LHR. Having read several reviews particularly around the level of business class service we were somewhat apprehensive prior to travelling. In the event we found the overall product to be high quality and at an operational level all flights departed on time and allowed connections to be made easily. It is true that its down to you to request drinks throughout the flight but requests were met in a friendly way. In fact there was certainly no lack of friendliness or smiles from the cabin crew unlike other reviews on this site. Comfort levels were great in the A330 flat bed sectors the London to IST sectors on the A321 compare very favourably to other carriers short haul business class. The lounge at IST is also to be highly commended although very busy (xmas). Overall we were very satisfied all round and would use them again and would recommend.,Promoter
Got a very cheap discount ticket from Milan (Italy) to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and return. Each sector was on time and operated by an aircraft with decent legroom. Meals on board were excellent more bistro than airline food! Transiting at Istanbul airport is as painful as getting through packed Gulf hubs (as Doha and Abu Dhabi) but this is the unavoidable part of the journey! Just two cons: Most of cabin crew and ground staff at IST have really basic English skills. In Dec 2013 online check-in was not available at KL airport making the pre-flight experience a bit hectic.

IST to Gatwick London on 25th as a Gold member with other Star Alliance airlines they did not provide a priority baggage handling tag. Lounge at IST was excellent but far too busy at least 10 mins to find a seat and another 10 mins to queue for the foods. If you want to have a shower you may need to wait 90 mins. From London to Istanbul on 30th I was not allowed to use the lounge not allowed to increase check-in baggage allowance and could not check my bags to my final destination. When I re-checked my bags in Istanbul they would not check-in my bag again to Melbourne only to Singapore asked me to re-check them in Singapore. After I arrived in Singapore I checked with ground staff of Singapore airlines who helped me to re-direct my bags to Melbourne and I did not have to do it myself again. The cabin service with TK: staff very unfriendly and do not want to provide services at all. The toilet was disgusting. Only good thing about TK is that they provide a good travel kit.,Passive
The B737-800 used by Turkish airlines (IST-ISB) is completely unsuitable for a journey of over 4000km and lasting 5 hrs 35 mins. The seats are tiny and the leg room not great even for 5'10 person.

In December 2013 we flew from Istanbul to JFK - Flight 0003. We had previously flown from JFK to Istanbul a week earlier so we knew what to expect as far as seat comfort movie selection and meals. This time however the flight crew was very different from the last crew. It was obvious from the moment we walked on the plane that the crew was unfriendly and unprofessional. They seemed completely unconcerned for the well being of the passengers. We received a tiny cup of coffee at take off and did not get any more in the 11 hour flight! The beverage cart only came around when meals were served - twice! The bathroom went from clean to disgusting in about three hours and remained that way.

The overall service is fair. I was booked in economy premium from Scotland to Turkey and then Turkey to Bangladesh. Although I collected my boarding pass for both parts of the journey from Edinburgh airport where I was allocated my chosen seat. On my trip to Bangladesh the cabin crew at the boarding gate had cut my seat number (12K) on the boarding gate with a pen and gave me seat at the very back of the plane.

The seats were a bit cramped could have more legroom. On African sectors brand new B 737-900ER were used. These planes are very comfortable leather seats with good legroom and big seatback screens with latest movies. I must say that they were nicest on-aisle planes I ever flown with. On all sectors the meal and drink service was very good cannot remember when I last could select my meals from menu card in economy class. The cabin service was professional and friendly. Some lack of cabin discipline though people were allowed to walk around and tray tables were used immediately after take-off. All flights arrived on-time and bags delivered.

MAN-IST-ICN. First time flying with Turkish Airlines. Booked my flights in June and travelled in December. Itinerary showed B739 and B773 but ended up flying in B738 and A340. The B738 was old and there was overhead screen for entertainment for MAN-IST a 4 hour flight. My seat's earphone plug-in was spoilt therefore inflight entertainment was as good as non-existed. IST-ICN flight entertainment was good but limited choices. Amenities were given on the IST-ICN flight which includes eye mask lip balm ear-plugs socks and slippers. The cabin was warm for some reason it was not like other airline's where the cabin would be cold. Food was tasty but not delicious. Service was average. Rarely notice any drink rounds on the 10 hour flight but they provided a bottle of water after meal.

Overall the flight from IST-IAH was very comfortable. The leg room and the comfort class seats were very comfortable.

FCO-IST-ADS-IST-BCN over a 4 day period early December. A320 or 737 aircraft - all in decent shape. Seat comfort is fine and on the 737s the leg room was larger then some premium economy flights I've been on. Where Turkish excels is the food - quality and quantity beat any airline hands-down and I've travelled on over a hundred airlines. Flight attendants were friendly and all spoke English well. On-time or within 10 minutes of schedule - Ataturk Airport is a mess and all flights arrived or departed via gate stand so dealing with buses to and from the planes gets annoying. Overall for the money paid Turkish gives a good product. Again - as stated by many people- they keep their planes too warm. I wouldn't fly them on anything longer then 4 hours.,Promoter
Just flew from LAX to IST in Comfort Class and economy from IST to DXB and back to LAX. The aircraft's were comfortable clean and the food above average in all classes flown. The FA's were polite and very friendly. I had a very tight connection on the way back from Dubai in Istanbul and my luggage made it to the connecting flight and my bags were undamaged. I commend Turkish on their service and professionalism. I will certainly fly them again.,Promoter
I recently has 2 horrible experiences with this airline on my DC-Istanbul-Mumbai and Mumbai-Istanbul-Chicago flights. On my flight from Washington DC-Istanbul I received sub standard service from one of the air hostesses. Even after 4 requests I did not get any headsets. I was served dinner late and without any bread. The air hostess plainly ignored my request for coffee. While coming back from Mumbai-Istanbul I had booked row 29 seats but when I checked in I was given row 46 boarding passes that were not window seats. For window seats she offered me row 53 inflight row 53 was indeed the last row and I couldn't do anything. The food quality was not at all good and asking a preferred (Vegetarian or Special) meal doesn't make any difference. I will never fly Turkish again.,Detractor
"This was my first time on Turkish Airlines (Helsinki-Istanbul-Helsinki). The plane was ok I liked the leather seats and there was enough space for me. The seats seemed a bit ""worn out "" to me though. The plane could have been tidier I guess it had just brought passengers to Helsinki and there was only a little time to clean it. The toilets were much cleaner than on other airliners' planes which was nice. Food was really good and it felt luxurious to be able choose from two menus! They showed quite new movies during the flight but when we flew back to Helsinki there was no sound coming from the audio system. This problem affected all the passengers not just me. The flight attendant couldn't do anything about this problem. What really upset me was the cabin crew's attitude on safety matters. Flight attendants didn't care at all about the position of passengers' seats tray tables or hand luggage during take off and landing. It definitely didn't give a good impression of safety issues. I have also got used to cabin crew paying attention to seat belt sign during turbulent weather but they just let people move around and use toilets normally.",Passive
Flew CAI-IST-EZE. CAI-IST with A321 great Business Class seats was disappointed in 18 hrs trip to Buenos Aires when I booked back in August I was supposed to fly on the B773. However THY changed to A343 which was uncomfortable for this journey. Check-in was perfect food excellent as for the entertainment well the entire 18 hrs the entertainment was not working. Seats old and not as advertised. Lack knowledge in alcohol there is not trolley for alcohol drinks and they never ask you. If you pop that you need champagne or wine they might take 15 minutes to prepare it for you.,Passive
We flew IAH-IST-IAH in Business Class. The seat was extremely uncomfortable. The cabin temperature felt like a sauna. The food and the presentation was excellent.

The crew did not give the appearance of being approachable. Overall we were very impressed with their VIP Lounge and extremely disappointed with their check-in and onboard crew.,Detractor
Flew last month Sao Paulo - Istanbul - Sharm el Sheikh - Cairo - Istanbul - Paris. All flights were on time. Staff and food very good. Maybe there is a lack of knowledge about the wines. Concerning the seats it depends on the aircraft. On the segment Sao Paulo - Istanbul it was an A340 with lie flat business seat which is not perfect for a 13 hours flight. The A319 between Istanbul and Sharm was like all European business class seats that means seats the same as in economy just a curtain between coach and business. Cairo - Istanbul A321 great seats 2X2 very comfortable for a 2 hours flight and the best seat was on the A330 between Istanbul and Paris. Full flat seat. A lot of room. Food was very good on all flights. A very good airline.,Promoter
CPT to LGW via IST in economy. Another great flight with Turkish. Comfortable seating on both flights. Helpful and pleasant staff. Special meal provided as requested.

Baggage at LGW took a long time but that the fault of Gatwick airport rather than the airline.,Promoter

IFE was perfect. Though I appreciated the footrest this is not a comfortable seat. I tossed and turned for the 12 hour flight finding it impossible to get a wink. High marks for the food.

IST-AMS A332. Friend and I were in the CIP lounge where the staff remind you to keep track of your own flight status. We had plenty of time arrived at the lounge 2.5hrs prior to departure. At 1.5hr prior to departure I went for a smoke and the flight status was not open. After 10mins when I returned the status was last call. This was a bus gate boarding and was really unsatisfactory.

IST-GVA-IST. No problems except the utterly uncomfortable seats and the heat in the airplane. Although it is a short flight sitting 3+ hours in the their A320 seats is a torture the pitch must have been adjusted by the millimetre to squeeze in one or two more rows. Seats are hard and although I am of average height my knees toughed the front seat. The crew were as previously experienced on THY dull and not particularly friendly. Smiles are rare unfortunately. I do sometimes take this flight as it is the only direct connection between GVA and IST the option is with LX via ZRH but although it takes more time flying with Swiss is way more comfortable and you have a friendly crew.,Detractor

I flew to Istanbul and back to Shanghai. On the first leg the flight was delayed 1 hour. When boarding was completed the flight was delayed another 40 mins due to air traffic control. I found a travel kit and slippers on the seat. Inflight wi-fi was not working. Food was quite good but no Chinese meal. Cabin crew worked very quickly and cleaned the toilets regularly. It was very cold in the cabin no one paid attention to it. On the way back the flight was on time. The other things were almost the same. Cabin crew and ground handling agents at Istanbul airport worked fast but did not seem to want to communicate with customers.,Passive
Whereas they claim to be Europe's best airline their ground services are appalling. My flight TK60 on 19 November to Kuala Lumpur was supposed to have left at 00.55 was delayed 6 hours. I landed in Istanbul at 22.20 from Germany to avail of the connecting flight. It was a nightmare to be stuck in Istanbul airport to face their most unprofessional and rude ground staff. A meal voucher was handed to me around 2.00 as though they were doing me a big favor. I have found their ground staff from security personnel to customer service very rude. Most airlines depend more on their economy passengers for profit. The rude attitude towards their economy passengers mar their slogan of being a 4 star airline. I will avoid Turkish airlines in future.,Detractor
I was flying from Europe to Shanghai than back from Kathmandu. On the first leg of my journey I was really amazed by the quality and quantity of food and drinks.

London to Dhaka via Istanbul twice in the last month. Usually I have a good experience with Turkish. However this time it was not so great. The London to Istanbul segments were mostly OK with the exception of the last return flight which was one of the most unpleasant flights I have had in a long time. It started with the children from hell in the row behind. The aircraft was an older A321 which had very poor leg room no IFE to speak of and it was too hot. One lady was quite ill because of the heat. The cabin crew refused to do anything despite complaints. I think everyone just wanted to get off so we were not pleased at having to fly around London on hold for half an hour. The Istanbul/Dhaka part is not operated by Turkish but by Meridiana an Italian charter operation. The A330 aircraft are old and do not come close to the normal Turkish standard. The IFE was very limited - no video on demand seats were old and business seats were basic and not worthy of the price. All airlines seem to put their worst and oldest aircraft on the routes into this part of Asia. I have flown with Emirates and Qatar Airways and both do the same. It is unfair as you do not pay any less for the ticket. On the positive side the overcrowding of the business lounge in Istanbul has improved. I did not have to sit on the floor on any of the 3 times I used it.,Detractor
I flew Turkish a couple of times in the past months and the most conspicuous feature was the seats lacking the adjustable headrest often the lack of the footrest and the lack of personal in-flight entertainment. The food was just sufficient. But the worst was on an international overseas flight of 2 hours where the in-flight entertainment on overhead screens was a football documentary. The staff were as kind and helpful as possible and the overall flight was satisfactory.,Passive
We travelled TK 1035 IST-BUD on 20 September. I had the window seat my partner the middle and an obese person who needed the extension seat belt was in the aisle.

Clean comfortable planes with plenty of leg room friendly crew members good meal on 4hr flight and snacks on short domestic flight.

I and my husband were traveling from LAX round trip. The travel agent did all booking so I suppose the pricing was fair. From LAX to Istanbul the plane was new and clean although restrooms after 3 hours were dirty until the end of 13 hour long flight. No soap no paper towels to dry wet hands on. Seats were uncomfortable we felt squashed between rows. Food was good. Service was OK. Entertainment was outdated. The air in the cabin was OK. Return from Istanbul to LAX the plane was full. This time we got an old plane seats were extremely uncomfortable food was bad and the air in the cabin was hot and stuffy toilet conditions were awful. Could not sleep a minute.

"GVA-IST-KTM return. Inconsistency is the hallmark of Turkish Airlines. It was very nice to have free drinks a nice dinner and an in-flight movie (screens above the seats) on a 3 hour European flight. However on the next leg to Kathmandu there was no seat-back IFE and when they played the movie you got English in one ear and Turkish in the other. (I would have liked a movie to block out the sound of the 3 infants near my seat.) On the way back there were seat back screens all the way even on the short-haul flight back to Geneva. The food was superb although I never know why airlines flying to majority Hindu countries don't have a vegetarian option and Turkish coffee would have been nice. Cabin attendants don't seem too concerned with safety (I don't think they check to see if seatbelts are done up) and while they may appear unfriendly I think many passengers don't pick up on the Turkish ""long-blink-with-pursed-lips"" facial expression equivalent of a smile. The policy of having one cabin attendant per trolley didn't seem to be too efficient. The two-class configuration on short haul (where one of the cabin attendants is designated as a ""chef"") may actually result in a lower staff-passenger ratio for economy passengers compared to a low-cost carrier where they need to sell. At times the staff seemed a bit overwhelmed Short delay on the Kathmandu flights - not a big deal but no explanation. On some sectors the pilots didn't address the passengers at all and other times they did. Finally the complementary tour of Istanbul for transit passengers (including food) is a nice touch. Clearly Turkish have the right idea they just need to standardise their product.",Passive

LHR-IST-DAC. LHR-IST in cramped A320 rushed and poor service with cabin crew having very poor English skills. Crew forgot to serve our row and when this was pointed out was shown palm as she was 'busy' and would deal with it when she had time. Finally got meal served 45 minutes later than other passengers. On arrival at Istanbul TK ground staff showed indifference to questions asked about the complimentary 'TourIstanbul' offer for long transits indicating I would have to find out at my own initiative if I could avail it and that they would not be able to provide any advise! Ataturk Airport is busy but has a good selection of duty free and some nice lounges. IST-DAC on leased Meridiana Aircraft. Terrible flight poor service. However flight departed on time and arrived early. I had no in-seat entertainment console/remote as it had been ripped off its place I assume hence was unable to view inflight entertainment - did not miss much it was only 5 channels of not-so-new movies. Cabin crew were lax with security and the service was very poor. TK takes pride in their 'Turkish Hospitality' but I found the hospitality of theirs quite poor to be truthful. I certainly will not be flying with them again. TK is no competition for the likes of EK QR or even BA for that matter.,Detractor
My decision to fly this time with Turkish was based on getting a flight at the most economic price with the shortest stopovers: Stuttgart via Istanbul to Cape Town and back. I was pleasantly surprised! The service at the counter was very professional and friendly. No long queues. No hassle with a bag being slightly too thick (having to be re-packed as done at other airlines) and an allowance of 30kg checked in baggage great. Unlike the often older aircraft used by other airlines the planes Airbus were modern and the entertainment systems worked. The food and refreshments excellent! Service good. What a pleasant surprise to be able to purchase goods at the airport in Istanbul in Euros. My only advisory comment is that Turkish need to train their staff how to handle difficult (or rude) customers as they sometimes seemed to be impatient with these. I will definitely fly Turkish again and highly recommend it.,Promoter

Our family of five adults recently traveled from Los Angeles (LAX) to IST to DAR and back. The new lounge in IST is gorgeous! The LAX-IST legs were excellent: comfortable seats attentive staff good food. The IST-DAR legs were only fair: seat controls didn't work staff was less than attentive food was mediocre. But the biggest problem we had was with the online reservation system. Even though I had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in. Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in. By using the electronic ticket numbers (and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didn't exist) the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes. Very frustrating! Finally they figured out a work-around and we were able to board.,Passive
I flew Turkish Airlines for the first time recently and was very impressed. I just flew shorter flights between Athens and Istanbul and Izmir and Istanbul but found the cabin crew to be professional and gracious and even on a one hour regional flight still received a meal of a whole grain roll with cheese green lettuce and tomato with some yoghurt as well. After flying United with its deathly pale iceberg lettuce and overcooked food on a long flight it was really refreshing! Maybe I was on the newer planes but they were so clean and with individual screens even on shorter flights. Great experience.,Promoter

Flight from Istanbul to KL service-wise was flawless and seamless. Very attentive service needs were taken care of before you asked and very good food although I have had even better food on other THY flights. My real issue is with the business class seat sleeping comfort on the A340-300.I am not sure at what angle the seat reclines but it is pretty nasty I was annoyed because the ticket price was pretty high. I wonder why Turkish a forward looking airline as using the A340-300 on the IST-KL run with this seating arrangement in business class.

I flew business class from CGK-IST-AMS overall it was a great experience but unfortunately it was not very memorable. The seat itself was great and comfortable the cabin layout was modern and clean however I found out that the cabin crew seemed to be inconsistent.

On the other side indeed there were the dedicated cabin crew who were willing to care and serve the passengers. My verdict is THY is still great airline to fly but it is not really that consistent compared to other airlines.,Passive
Four flights with Turkish in the past two weeks - all in economy. Cape Town to Istanbul Istanbul to Paris London Gatwick to Istanbul and Istanbul back to Cape Town. All flights were on time or early. The planes were reasonably new clean and comfortable. The flight back to Cape Town was completely full but even that wasn't uncomfortable. The staff were always helpful and polite. The seats are reasonably comfortable with good pitch - my gripe is the foot rest which isn't convenient if you are tall and gets in the way when folded up. The entertainment system is varied and the screens large (no individual screens on the plane from Gatwick). Food was plentiful and tasty. And there are a few extras - a substantial amenity kit - sometimes in a tin. Slippers and a Turkish delight as a welcome sweet. And in addition their prices are excellent so it doesn't surprise me that they keep winning awards.,Promoter

Attendants were pleasant but not smiling Turkish people are very kind its a shame it does not come across on most of the staff. I found the ground staff in Istanbul all excellent and efficient. I fly with Turkish a few times a year and will continue to do so.,Promoter
We flew economy from Bangkok to HCMC (Saigon). The cabin was the dirtiest I've encountered. When I opened the tray table there was vegetable matter there gravy had dripped down the seat as well as what looked like cola. The floor hadn't been cleaned as there were food scraps along the floor mounts. No IFE at all. Food was a dismal chicken and cheese sandwich and a slice of cake. One of the exit lamps was playing up so the attendant whacked it with her hand - to no avail. Cabin crew were inattentive and appeared bored. This flight originated in Istanbul and flew to HCMC via Bangkok. Perhaps the crew didn't change in BKK? The plane was an older 777-300 and the seats looked like they needed a good scrub. By comparison the business class seats looked good. It beats me how this airline has won 'Best European Airlines' 3 years running.,Detractor

Flew TK071 HKG-IST on 29/08/2013. There was a delay of 30 mins or so no explanation from crews. Inflight entertainment and the food was superb. However the cabin crew were so unfriendly and they disappeared after the first service. No water or beverages offering during the flight until next service (breakfast) 2.5 hours before landing. I won't be travelling with Turkish Airlines until they improve their customer service.,Detractor
My first TK A330-300 trip my first Y experience on TK for a long time. The plane was full. I have never seen speciality meals delivered through the same door the pax were boarding very unprofessional. FA asking the gate agents to check some luggage (gate check) they had no idea how to deal with it. I have never seen giant garbage bags piled up at the doors during the flight as if there was no place to store it. Never seen one of the chefs coming off from his rest in a t-shirt carrying his uniform in his hand. It was chaotic for the whole flight constant shuttling of food trays bags drinks back and forth. Slow inattentive service. Good luck to the cleaning crew to turn it around on time. On the plus side most of the front lavatories were larger than I'm used to Thanks to the inflight entertainment iphone and my noise cancelling headphones I was happy. The Y seats were not comfortable for me for the 10.40 hrs flight. I hope I never have to do that again.,Detractor
My wife and I had a Business Class trip from Istanbul to Hamburg on 9th September. My seat was 01D. The backrest kept moving in rest position and could only be brought back manually after 5 min. The safety belt with the lock was twisted by 180 degrees and could not be refitted on the plane. The stewardess just told me to take another seat. The luggage marked with the priority label arrived on the conveyor belt approx after 50% of all suitcases. These small faults shows me that this Airline is not consistent in the quality of their technical standards. After this trip I asked myself how this Airline deals with bigger technical problems. I cannot recommend it.,Detractor
London to Istanbul 16/08/13 flight TK1980. 2 out of my last 3 flights were delayed. One for 6 hrs on a 3.5 hrs flight and another 1.15 hrs on 50 min flight. There is lack of information and communication from ground staff and poor customer relations. I find food to be average. Never had any problems with cabin crew as they are very professional. I think Turkish Airlines expanded its fleet and destinations too much too soon and now cannot manage it properly.,Passive

Istanbul - Odessa. Flight was full but left and landed on time. Cabin crew were good and managed to serve a reasonable meal on this short flight.

Singapore to Dublin via Istanbul and return Dublin to Singapore also via Istanbul. Appreciate the night kit that they provide on the overnight flight from Istanbul to Singapore. It was in a metal box which is sort of nice and could be a collector's item. First time that I had received such a nice night kit for an overnight flight. Food was good. IFE was reasonably good though films are not the latest. Cabin crew was kept busy as their flights are full on all the four sectors. Turkish Airlines must be doing something right to be attracting some many customers. A consequence of the full flight was the toilets were not cleaned and one was choked throughout the flight back to Singapore without anyone clearing it. Overall a nice experience with THY.,Promoter

In general cabin and toilets were in a good condition when knowing it was an older version of an Airbus A320. Keep it up TK.,Promoter
" Doha to Hong Kong. Qatar Airways offer their state of the art QSuites on this route, it is a pleasure but if you are 192 cm or more in height it may be uncomfortable.

Cabin WiFi was good.",Passive
" Bangkok to Gatwick via Doha. Ground service in Bangkok was mixed, check in and security were fine and very quick. Disappointed that the nice ticket wallets seem to no longer be issued (I wondered if it was a glitch on my outbound).. hardly necessary but was a nice touch. The lounge showers were not working. Thankfully I knew I could use the JAL lounge which was close by, but this was not offered by the staff when I made clear my disappointment at theirs not functioning. Other than that the lounge was excellent. Premium feeling but lovely food and drink options, very attentive professional staff and a nice mix of comfy and practical seating. Annoyingly the lounge was absolutely no where near the gate they were using tonight, approx 20 min walk. Whilst you expect this at the airlines hub airport, you do not expect it when at another world airport. With only a handful of flights a day and a dedicated lounge it should be possible to fly from gates at least on the same side of the airport. When eventually getting to the gate, having been prompted by lounge staff that the plane was boarding, all bus passenger had to stand for another 15 mins before they actually started boarding as the gate was so packed full there were no seats. Lounge in Doha is cavernous. Having visited a few times now I have decided that overall I don't like it, and as Qatar airways expands and the lounge gets busier I like it less and less. Because it is just open space it always feels busy. The chairs are not particularly comfortable and there are coffee/soft drinks stands dotted about fairly sparsely, with main food and drink at either end. Obviously there are staff walking around who can provide you drinks, but I prefer more self service drinks to also be available. On board the service was excellent on both flights. Wonderful crew, and good quality food and drinks. Seats are very comfortable. On the 777 it was the old seat, although I actually really like this. It's not quite fully flat but still very nice with excellent storage and I slept well. IFE is fine. Lots of choice and good resolution however the interface is clunky and unresponsive on both systems. The new one on Qsuite is much better. Landing in Gatwick reminds me that in spite of a lot of improvements Gatwick is still a horrible airport.. but it is convenient for me. Bags arrived quickly and immigration had a short queue. Overall flight was excellent although very slight downgrades in quality, and price increases are making this not quite as appealing for leisure travellers. Being Oneworld is a massive perk as tier point collection for BA is very good.",Promoter
" Unbelievable level of personalised service even in the cheap seats. My wife and I have just completed 4 flights with Qatar Airways. Travelling to London from Melbourne via Doha and return. The first thing we noticed was the extended boarding time on the A380 which ensured orderly and relaxed boarding with no pushing and shoving and fighting for overhead bin space. The inflight service on 3 of the 4 flights was the best we have ever had in economy class. The service on the second flight while not in the same class as the other 3 flights was certainly as good as our regular carrier SQ so to complain would be pedantic. The choice of 3 options of meal (1 of which is vegetarian) at meal times was a pleasant addition and all meals I ate on all flights were full flavoured generous in size healthy and a step above the mush some airlines offer. Plenty of snacks and beverages offered throughout the flight. In short food and beverage is plentiful and with the extended choice of options should satisfy most passengers. Seat comfort (we had 3 A380 flights and 1 B787) was terrific enough legroom and width, the A380 was a little more generous and much quieter in the cabin than the B787. In fact the A380 certainly was the clear winner between both plane variants. The inflight entertainment system Oryx 1 was superb and offered a great selection of movies from new releases through to classics from the golden years of Hollywood, Music selection was the best I have encountered on an inflight entertainment system and I listened to a fair few full length albums to while away the time. Finally big shout out to the excellent Qatar flight crews who were professional, exuberant and hardworking with no crew vanishing acts here like most long hauls where you struggle to find crew after the first main meal service. In fact my wife mentioned as we were at the baggage carousel at Tullamarine, that it was the freshest she had ever felt after a long haul flight home, given we did London Doha (6.5 hours) 3 hours in the Oryx Lounge at Doha, then Doha To Melbourne (13.5 hours) . Qatar Airways have now won my long haul business. Unfortunately with no direct Melbourne Singapore or Melbourne Vietnam services I am still shackled to SQ whose standards have been slipping for the last 3 years. Thank you Qatar see you again in September when I test drive your new Lisbon route.",Promoter
" Doha to Munich. Crew: Awesome, dedicated, beautiful, pleasant, and attentive. The crew and the supervisor onboard of the flight were top notch. The best that I have interacted with compared to other airlines. The crew kept checking in with me to see if I am comfortable. Aircraft: The Qsuite was clean, comfortable and private. The in-flight entertainment system was responsive and showed no signs of lag. F&B: Spoilt for choices. The signature drink was a blast. Fine dining experience. Overall, the food was awesome. Overall, this airline has won my heart. I was smitten by the level of service and I will keep on flying with QR.",Promoter

" Johannesburg to London via Doha. Normally I love Qatar Airways but this experience wasn't so good. When I flew LHR to JNB via DOH everything was great. The brilliant service, plenty of food, great entertainment system and nice aircraft. The way back was not as good. The check-in assistant at JNB was incredibly rude as he spoke to his colleague the whole time he was checking me in and looked at me in a contemptuous way. I suspect he might be employed by the airport as I had the same experience at passport control and security. The route JNB - DOH was ok. The plane was nice and spacious and the seats were very comfortable. A female passenger moved next to me because the passenger behind her had placed her bare feet in full view on the first passenger's armrest. No one told her to put her feet away. They ran out of beef and chicken dishes and only had vegetarian left which I refused to eat as it was dal and spinach which seemed like a bad choice for a flight. The attendants tried really hard to find alternatives and credit to them for their efforts and professionalism. The airline needs to review its meal quotas for each flight. The route DOH - LGW was cramped and uncomfortable - the seats didn't go back as far. The snack was a choice of pizza or pizza with chicken. I don't eat cheese but luckily a member of the cabin crew found me something else. Staff were also great on this flight. The onboard WIFI is terrible. On two separate flights I signed up for the one hour free. The WIFI wouldn't connect until the hour was up, at which point it told me free WIFI was no longer an option. On the other two flights it worked ok but had periods where it wouldn't connect. Compared to Emirates, Qatar Airways staff are friendlier and more obliging and they give you more food. If all Qatar Airway's planes were as good as the JNB-DOH route and they didn't run out of food then they would definitely be my favourite airline.",Passive

" I know Qatar Airways well after flying them for a couple of years and maintaining my Platinum frequent flyer status. I noticed some decline in the standard of their business class product over the last year or so. Qatars big strength was always its consistency of their business class. That is not the case anymore. The flight from Stockholm to Doha was top notch service wise, but the flight to Singapore was a different matter. The Qsuite was great as always, but service wasn't. The Purser in charge never introduced herself or said goodbye, nothing. The lady in charge of my section was obviously hating her job. No smile, very slow and chaotic service, wine was served after the main course. My seat could not move 2h before arrival and I had to sit on the bed for breakfast. When the plane started to descend, I was still sitting and my third reminder to look at the seat was ignored by her. I asked someone else and within 5 minutes I was given another seat for landing. Overall a rather disappointing flight, I hope my return next week will be better.",Detractor

" Barcelona to Mumbai via Doha in Economy class, paid to upgrade to business on DOH-BOM segment during online check in. On balance this was a good experience, not great. BCN-DOH on an A350 that apparently is owned by Latam and operated by Qatar. Branding was Qatar, but business class configuration was pure Latam - ie 2x2x2 - hence when they asked for in excess of 700 Euro to upgrade for a 6.5 hour flight I passed. Economy was pleasant as the flight wasn't crowded and I had three seats to myself. I did opt to upgrade on the DOH-BOM segment, as it was a Q-suite configured aircraft, and priced at just over 300 euro for a late night three hour flight arriving at 2:30am. India flights all running full post Jet Airways collapse so I thought it smart to upgrade. The Q-suite product is very good, although I found the suite a bit claustrophobic. Service was good. There's a bit of a cool demeanor with their cabin crews. Zero special treatment or recognition for Oneworld Emerald for seat allocation or onboard. The Doha lounge was overrated and almost appalling for me. In summary, the trip was good, not spectacular.",Passive
" Washington to Bangkok in economy class on a 777. I arrived 70 minutes before the flight, leaving 10 minutes to spare before the official cutoff time. There were three ticket agents and no one else in line. However, there apparently was some debate over who would have to serve me, as no one would check me in. Several times a clock behind the counter was pointed to, and the agents wandered off without acknowledging me. Finally a supervisor asked one of the agents to take care of me. The agent again pointed to the clock (which at this point was still about 7 minutes prior to the cutoff) but the supervisor pointed to the work station and finally I was attended to. On board, the flight crew seemed neglectful, we were pushing back during the safety presentation and there were passengers standing in the aisles. The inflight experience was fine. The seats were comfortable, legroom was adequate, and the cabin was clean, and even economy class gets an amenity kit. The meals were the highlight, with multiple cuisines on offer. An hour of free wifi is included for anyone who pays enough attention to read these things, and the connection speed was truly exceptional. The only complaint about the inflight experience was the headphone jack. If you want to use your own headset, bring a two pronged adapter, or you'll suffer through the adequate but not much-more-than-that headset provided. My second flight was 10 hours after my first, and the Doha Airport is a tragic experience unless you have, or pay for lounge access. or you have a desire to shop for high end luxury brands of clothing and luggage. The connecting flight was just like the first, but with no seat charging options. A bit surprising to not have that option, but the entertainment system was good enough to keep me amused. All in, this was better than my last few experiences on Qatar, and I wouldn't tell friends to avoid them. Just get there earlier than the cutoff, and bring a battery and a headphone adapter.",Passive
 Belgrade to Sydney via Doha. I decided this year to do my Balkans trip with Qatar having used Lufthansa and Emirates before. What a classy Business class. Now i know why they are voted the best in the world. The service from Doha to Sydney was fantastic and also the trip going over to Belgrade. This airline is without doubt leaving the others in there wake. Having had to fly Qantas to get to Sydney and vice versa Business class it makes you realise how poor our own Qantas airline is. The cabin crew on Qatar know how to serve (thats a word lacking in our countries airline) they were tireless in there quest to serve great meals and wine and ensure we were well looked after. Pity they do not fly to Brisbane which would avoid the sub standard Q we have to use. Well done Qatar you're great.,Promoter
" Doha to New York. The Airbus A350-1000 is the latest addition to Qatar Airways' fleet, with its Q Suites that have been raved as the best business class product in the world. In my opinion, it is indeed the best business class product I experienced to date. First and Business Class passengers had their own vast premium check-in area and, not a separate line but a separate security screening facility, which made the whole process peaceful and seamless. The lounge at Doha airport was huge and beautiful. It was quite crowded when I came as it took me a while to find a dining table. However, it did not seem like a chronic issue as it was cleared shortly after. Food offerings were OK, not inspiring providing this was their home base. The gate area, though, was tight and crowded, but I think that was more about the airport. However, as QR is the main operator of the airport, I am surprised why they do not exercise their influence on the design of the gate, which has just been recently completed, to match their excellent service. My Q Suite, in my opinion, was the most intelligently designed business class seat I have seen (those included AA, DL, UA, CX, CI, JL, RJ, BR, TK, BA, OZ, VN, KE, GA and more). The suite may have appeared a bit claustrophobic with the door closed, but it felt totally different with generous shoulder room and hip room, which made sleeping so easy and comfortable. QR offered pajamas and turn down service, a first class perk. Cabin service and food were excellent, and meals were presented nicely, a la carte and on demand. I really enjoyed the flight.",Promoter

 Flight from Bangalore to Doha was an early morning flight. Extremely orderly boarding process followed by informative captains announcement. One gripe on this leg was the aircraft was on the colder side with no blanket! They had a few and was handed out for people who requested them. The food was good and the flight attendants were as always very attentive. On landing though we had to take a bus from the aircraft to the terminal. This caused a lot of people to panic and run to their connections. I had a two hour layover but had just enough time to make it to my gate. The second leg was a longer flight - this time the aircraft was newer and the seat back entertainment system was of higher quality. Meal service was good and timely. They served two main meals with a snack in the middle. As always the flight attendants were very attentive. Unusually they ran short of the lamb option! As for the seat - my seat was very uncomfortable. It was behind an exit row. Both the seat anchor from the front seat and the seat back entertainment system took away a major portion of the foot space. Had to find an angle to sit for the whole 12 hour journey. On arrival it took nearly an hour to retrieve bags - which is understandable. The takeoff/landing and pilot announcements were all extremely good!,Passive

Onward journey was on a newer Boeing 787-8. The legroom is still not bad. The seat width leaves much to be desired. No position allowed me to sit without rubbing elbow on the armrest.

She took out a mechanical contraption, placed my card on it and over it a multiple sheets credit card slip and then pulled a slide over them to get the imprint.

" Birmingham to Manila via Doha return in economy class. Overall a pleasant experience across the four sectors flown with only one delay of less than 30 minutes due to a passenger feeling unwell. The BHX-DOH sectors were on a B787, which was probably starting to show its age. For example the AVOD system on these planes is not as sleek as on the B777 which were used for the DOH-MNL sectors, however both provided a good selection of movies both new and old, TV shows, music and games. Seats are generally comfortable although the box for the AVOD system cuts into legroom if you are seated by the aisle or window. The recline is good on both planes as the lower portion of the seat moves forward slightly as the back portion reclines, giving slightly more recline overall. The quality of the food was generally excellent across all sectors, however I was disappointed that on three of the four sectors my first choice was unavailable by the time I was served. On one occasion the air stewardess did make up for this slightly by offering me a crew meal which was similar, however it would be better if the meal choices were available to more of the passengers. Drinks were available throughout the flights although in between meal service you need to go to the galley and ask. We were provided with an amenity kit on the DOH-MNL sectors which included an eye mask, travel socks, toothpaste, toothbrush and lip balm. Free Wi-Fi was available for a limited time on all sectors although the speed on the DOH-MNL sectors was much better - again this might be due to the age of the aircraft. USB ports were available on both planes to charge devices. For the price I paid I was very happy with the service provided and would definitely use Qatar Airways again.",Promoter
" Bangalore to London via Doha. The Qatar Airways Qsuite seems like an awesome product but there wasn't any space for my bag storage. The service from Bangalore was top notch and impeccable. Yet again the cabin crew make all the difference. Unfortunately a delay at Doha due to the late arrival of the aircraft, but had the usual 1x2x1 layout with no Q suite. However a special mention to cabin crew from Thailand who was the real star of this five star airline. Extremely polite, superb service on board and hats off to her. Unfortunately the food quality at the Al Mourjan lounge seems to be declining.",Promoter
 Atlanta to Karachi via Doha. This is my first time flying with Qatar airways in the last decade. I chose Qatar airways rather than Emirates because of better route options from Atlanta. This was also our first time taking our 20 months old on a long trans-atlantic flight. I must say i was very happy with the service I got during both flights. The crew was very professional and they always went an extra mile to accommodate the needs of our child. Further the transit at Doha was also fabulous with options available for business lounges and we got stroller for our child complimentary. I would recommend Qatar airways any day. I will most likely move from Emirates club to Qatar airways club. I shall update the review on our flight back home to ATL.,Promoter

I think it could have been more space for your feet, when you make a bed out of your chair. This was an evening flight, duration 8 hours. The crew were very slow, and almost two hours to serve food, and i got only half of my order. Then it was not much time left for sleeping.",Passive
" London to Lahore via Doha. London to Doha A380, 9 am flight on time from Heathrow, an aisle seat with leg room. Flight comfortable and breakfast served. Doha to Lahore Boeing 777 not a new aircraft and fully booked. Again an aisle seat with hard cushion and less leg room. Meal served somewhat uninspiring, but cabin crew efficient as always. Arrived in Lahore on time. Return flight from Karachi to Doha - very early departure (3 am) but check in etc still quick and we left on time-aircraft airbus A350, relatively new and more spacious than the 777. Seats comfortable and enough leg room - I am over 6' tall-leg room is important. Before take off passenger in the seat in front of me was sick, cabin crew quickly provided sick bags and a more senior cabin crew member questioned her about her medication. We took off but the passenger and her son were moved elsewhere in the plane. Crew handled the situation well and other passengers were moved to the seats as the plane was full. Breakfast was served but was very ordinary.",Passive

During the 9-hr journey, there were crews walking around and checking if guests need any assistance, drinks. My connection time from Doha to Vienna was quite long as 8hr 15mins, which was expected when I bought my ticket. I was fine with it. As I reached Doha at 2335 hrs, I was unable to do anything at the airport. Although the connection time was more than 8hrs, no meal vouchers were provided by the airline. At around 0700hrs, guests were informed that there will be a delay and the next information will be released by 0945 - nothing was given to us. They just gave 1 announcement regarding this issue and mentioned that it is a technical problem.

Arrive at airport checking in to Porter Air, they tell me my flights are being deleted and I need to call Qatar. Finally, Air Canada reaches me and for some reason I was moved from Porter which I booked, and now was placed on Air Canada (a company I try to avoid). I contact customer service once in Thailand on my trip to inquire about the screw up. They tell me all is fine and this was not an issue. I try to check in before flight going home, can't check in. Can't contact Qatar, their phone number is in Doha and I am not paying to call them for poor service. Arrive at airport 2hrs and 20min before flight. Huge lineup for Qatar Airways with only two economy counters open. Also a line for web check-in drop off bags - which would have been great had Qatar allowed me to check in online.

The customer service personnel at Hamad Int'l airport were very helpful, professional and kind. At first I was going to be charged for the change in flight, but when I explained the situation, Qatar Airways understood and did not charge me a cent (especially thankful after a long flight and being very tired). That is first class service. Thank you to Qatar Airways for this help. A recommendation to be considered, any changes in airport policies or procedures (new or from old practices), it would be great if an email is sent to all who purchased the tickets, I don't think this would be very costly to the Qatar Airways and it would highly appreciated. Example: Hamad Int'l airport is a silent airport, I did not know that until I faced this issue. Please put notice on the screen if the time is departure or boarding time.

However, staff happily served us drinks when we press attendants' bell. Seats are decent for sitting, not so comfortable for sleeping in.

While not as spectacular as their QSuite, the seat design and comfort is still top of the line for its class.

" Mumbai to Doha, on a Boeing 777. On this flight we had the QSuite configuration. The seat hardware blows away all the competition. The comfort and space is closer to the First Class seating found on many other airlines. I haven't seen Singapore or Cathay Business in recent years (Qatar's closest competition) but I don't think either has anything like the seats of QSuite. Even the lavatory design is outstanding. Qatar's in-flight service is very good, but I would rank Lufthansa, Swiss and ANA a notch higher in this department. Where Qatar fell short is at the Al Mourjan Business Lounge in Doha. Physically it is an impressive space. However, during the morning peak hour it transforms into a bus station with all the unpleasantness that goes with it. It is surprising that Qatar hasn't thought through this as well as the energies they have put into their in-flight product. We had to stand outside for 15 mins for a shower and the restaurant upstairs was packed to the gills with many turned away due to lack of seating space.",Promoter

"  Copenhagen to Bangalore via Doha. This time my flights were a mixed bag and somewhat disappointing, especially the sectors BLR-DOH and DOH-CPH on 09 January 2019. Both flights full, the first leg being a real flight from hell because of screaming children who wouldn't stop during the 4 hr flight. QR has added an extra seat on their B777-200LR's as well as B777-300ER's during their latest refurbishment (3-4-3 in Economy), which makes the seating extremely cramped and the aisles too narrow. I'm 6""1' and due to the too narrow seat, it was very hard to find a comfortable position to eat or rest, the seat is simply not suitable for me. The cabin crew are all very good and hard-working, meals OK for Economy and the Oryx entertainment system way above many competitors, but I found it hard to enjoy all this due to the problems mentioned. We had 55 min connection at CPH (QR to SAS) but since QR was delayed due to an extremely long taxiing at DOH, we managed to catch SAS thanks to the security check and passport control at CPH, however, our bags didn't make it and came 24 hrs later due to the fact that QR has one ground handling agent at CPH and SAS another. All in all, QR is a good airline to fly with and DOH is a great airport as suggested by fellow travellers as well but, in my opinion, the cramped cabins in Economy don't reflect a five-star experience and the cabin crew struggle on the narrow aisles to provide five-star service they have been so well trained for. A mixed bag, really.",Passive

" Washington to Doha. I had an award ticket and wanted to change the date on my return. I have modified my ticket in the past during previous holidays and it was a relatively easy process usually completed with a single phone call to Qatar Airways customer service. I called Qatar Airways and the representative informed me that I should contact the Privilege Club department, as Qatar Airways does not deal with award tickets. I called the Privilege Club department which informed me that I need to submit my request using their online contact center. If this wasn't already a convoluted process, the automatic response to my request from the contact center was that I had to wait 3 business days before my request could be tended to. How is this practical when a customer needs to make an urgent change? My request was simple - I just wanted to know what dates were available for me to change my return ticket to and what the cost of implementing such a change would be. The response I finally received three business days later, was a generic one that did not even address my request. They replied stating that a change would cost $25 if completed 24 hours or more prior to departure and $100 if within 3 and 24 hours of departure. However, they did not provide me with any answer as to what dates were available for me to change my award ticket to. Not only did I have to wait for 3 business days to receive a response, but the response I received was completely unhelpful and useless. Having to wait 3 business days to get a response is unreasonable, especially when the responses are not helpful. My case was an urgent one and could not wait a week, let alone three business days. attempted to contact someone from the Privilege Department on Friday and was told that my request would be expedited. I tried to follow up the next day but because it was a Saturday, the offices were closed. I tried to call on Sunday and was informed that the office was closed. What is the point of being a privilege club member if the customer helpline is not open on Saturdays and Sundays while the general Qatar Airways customer service helpline is? I would rather be a standard, non-privilege customer and receive more reliable and timely customer service, than be a privilege club customer and have to wait days upon days for anything that even remotely resembles a response.",Detractor

Check-in in KGL took ages due to incompetent 3rd part company who don't know basic and ask a lot of superfluous questions which already are in the computer and on the BPs.

Q-suites is over-rated unless you fly in a group and want to be together. Was granted access to the Al Mourjan lounge in Doha which normally denies even One World elite travelers on upgrades. Terrible bus-gating in Doha. Takes hours and undermine any feel of the qualities provided onboard. They have separate biz buses to reduce the pain for elite travelers but the difference is minimal as all are reduced to public transport which only leaves when the bus is full. Worse is the charity announcements on board. Very introduce and ridiculous.

We had the new QSuites in business class, they are comfortable but lack storage so I had to put my shoes in the overhead. The food was poor, I choose the Arabic Mezza, they used to offer a full mezza previously, now it is only three selections with a tasteless taboula and hummus that lacked lemon and olive oil. The entertainment system was nice in the movie selection but poor on TV, the toilets are huge on Qatar Airways and very well stocked. Very friendly and attentive cabin staff.",Promoter

" Dallas to Bangkok via Doha. Avoid flying this airline if you have a heavy carry on - the carry-on weight limit is 7kg, my carry on weight totaled 9kg. I happened to have one check-in bag which was already 5lbs over limit. I could not place things inside the check-in bag from my backpack. SoI had to pay $700 extra to fly the same flight for the next day. This taught me the lesson of having a spare bag to carry that you can check in for the situation of having an overweight carry-on. I also learned the lesson of booking directly with Qatar Airways instead of an online website. You will pay hundreds of dollars extra to change a ticket with an online website. When I flew back from Bangkok , the ticketing agent there was also extremely anal retentive about my carry-on weight. I wish Qatar let people pay extra money (overweight baggage fee) in order to board. I would rather pay an extra $150 for a heavy carry-on than a $700 change ticket change charge.",Detractor

" Route: London Heathrow - Doha Hamad International. This flight was flown by the Airbus A380-800 of Qatar Airways, our seats were in the small economy cabin on the upper deck at the back of the plane. I suggest choosing the seats in front of the bulkhead because the recline is not restricted and there is extra space under your seat as well. The overhead lockers on the side are very small, only backpacks can be stored up there.

Efficient, tentative, friendly and doing all her best to make you feel super welcomed. Inflight entertainment consist of a good variety of selection and 30mins complimentary wifi is available and of acceptable speed. DOH-KUL in A330 5A. The cabin is half full.

" The website only permits one trip, but I wish to provide feedback for both inbound as well as outbound. The outbound was great, as I have come to expect with QR (who I have been flying with long haul premium for about 4 years). Nothing to be faulted. The 787 was a great business class, enhanced by the quality of the product and service. On the other hand, the 777 from Doha to JFK took the business class experience to a totally new level. The QSuites product, in my mind, is the best business class offering around, which compares favourably with the FC offering of some major airlines. Not to mention the numerous onboard staff and their fantastic service - in particular a young gent who led the onboard team from Doha to Jakarta on the return leg was outstanding! This is not to ignore the contributions of the other young gents and ladies who made both my trips a totally memorable experience. To summarise, QR business class was an outstanding product, mainly thanks to the commitment of their people. QR QSuites takes this to a totally new level! To get the perfect product, QR should either provide free internet for their premium customers (and reduce the pricepoint for the economy) or be more generous with the allowances, and reduce internet access prices. I suspect that this will happen soon anyway.",Promoter

" Doha to New York JFK. Excellent flight on a refurbished aircraft that has completely changed the business class travel experience on this route by creating a sense of big space while providing much needed privacy. On previous travel on this morning flight from Doha to JFK, the plane had a 2-2-2 open layout -- affording no privacy at all while being crowded, having to jump over a passenger if you were not on the aisle seat. Now, the new Q-Suite layout has changed all that. The configuration is 1-2-1, some seats face the back of the plane. There is a ""door"" that seals off your little cubicle equipped with all you need - plug and charge points, large pull out desk table to eat and work on, counters to keep your possessions, a hook to hang your coat, a cupboard for your footwear, reading lights, duvets, pillows, a large TV screen with numerous entertainment choices, and a seat that adjusts in many ways including lie flat. I was able to sleep several hours in absolute privacy in a window seat, 3A. The flight attendants are drawn from many countries of the world and they speak English well. There was a very large menu of food and drinks - cards listing them provided. Qatar provides meals and drinks on request throughout the flight. I am not partial to this form of service. One has to either call the flight attendant or go to the alley to place one's order -- they are delivered to your seat. Overall, the quality of the food is so-so but you are bound to find something that you fancy. Too much effort goes into laying the table cloth and the folded napkin across the waist and setting the place and cleaning it, time and again. Qatar is having an outsize impact on the environment by being so extravagant with their on-demand food and drink service. The flight was smooth and arrived on time. Choice of hot and cold towels were offered at take off and landing. Amenities kit was a hard shell bag, pink in color. Arrival was at Terminal 8 at JFK which is very good compared to the other terminals - in terms of space, facilities, and quickness of official services. I arrived alert and rested.",Promoter
" Kolkata to Doha. Smooth and comfortable late, late night flight in a window seat with very attentive service. The flight leaves Calcutta at 3:15 in the morning. Boarding was a bit tentative as passengers had been let into the aero bridge but the aircraft was not yet ready to board. Was welcomed on board, shown to seat, and coat taken to be hung in the closet. The spacious cabin was clean and designed in a 1-2-1 layout. Hot towels, welcome drinks, menu card, and an amenities package provided. Nicely groomed flight attendant from Chile was engagingly talkative! A large entertainment system was on offer including films from all over the world. Lie flat seat provided good sleep on this less than five hour flight and on waking up saw a beautiful sight of dawn breaking behind in the East. Breakfast had been selected in advance - an Indian vegetarian dish. It was served at the time requested. It was the only negative aspect of the flight - the food looked ugly, it was overly salted, and the ingredients could not be identified - virtually inedible. On arrival, the front door opened to a dedicated air bridge for biz cabin passengers to disembark. Departure and arrival on schedule. A very high quality product save for the meal.

 Zanzibar to Doha. Late afternoon departure from Zanzibar. The aircraft was an Airbus 320 with old-style Business class seats. I had a window seat in row 2 of 3. The flight was just over 6 hours long and I felt terribly uncomfortable for the whole duration of the flight. When the seats in front of me were fully reclined it gave a claustrophobic feeling and it was very difficult to get up from the seat. It would have been okay for 2 hours but not for 6. The service was a little confused with two FA's for a full Biz class cabin (12 pax). iPads delivered for entertainment but very limited selection.,Detractor
" Clark to Boston via Doha, the flight from Clark to Doha was lovely. Unfortunately, there were some problems at the gate for the flight to Boston in the Doha airport, such as a seat reassignment due to a supposed change in aircraft (which does not seem to have occurred after all), boarding which was delayed by about 40 minutes (which led to a departure which was 40 minutes late, too), and a staff member in charge of boarding who appears to have been angry at some passengers for not showing up only when their zone was called, despite her not audibly calling anyone up for boarding after the initial invitation for business class and special assistance passengers! The cabin crew for this particular flight were outstanding and made up for the issues with the ground staff! This particular flight featured quite possibly the worst turbulence I have ever endured in my life--and I once flew through a typhoon. The flight attendants managed to serve us meals during one of the bumpiest parts of the flight and did not drop or spill anything. They continued to smile and politely ask passengers if they needed anything else. One even offered me a special meal which another passenger had not shown up for! I am a big fan of Qatar Airways--so much so that I endure 8 hour long layovers in Doha every time I fly with them, just because the experience is wonderful every time. The food is delicious, creative, and plentiful. It's also often the cheapest ticket! This time for example, my round trip ticket was for less than $900!

Being a privilege club member I have nearly always taken advantage of the email offers to upgrade 1 or both legs of a flight for a very reasonable price. On this flight I thankfully read the offer through and noticed lounge access is not included and I dont see the value anymore in upgrading. 2nd leg of Doha-Helsinki was less than 1/3 full and business was completely empty and soon they will be upgrading the aircraft to A330 from Boeing 787 from Helsinki.",Passive

On arrival there was no stroller and I complained at Qatar airways office at Doha airport directly after arrival before leaving the airport. Since October 4th, I was trying to keep in touch with the baggage service team. I called many many time and every time they answered that they are waiting for the Montreal team to answered. Finally, the day before my flight back to Canada they told me that it's not Qatar airways liability that I miss the stroller. I agree that I have to have a tag number but if the staff told me that they cannot give me tag number because of the cargo problem that they have what I can do except trusting them.

It was the busiest time of the day at 6 am, and there was no seat, there were 21 people waiting for a shower which I was told would take 2h to clear. That lounge at peak hours, and the fact that there was no airbridge for arrival and departure with extra time spent to be driven to the plane in a remote position, were the only weakness I see in Qatar but they happen every time I fly.

" London to Colombo via Doha. Qatar Airways flies from London Heathrow Terminal 4. Check in was fast and efficient, we were offered last minute upgrades to business class for Â£590.00 for both of us on the DOH-CMB leg- we would have been happy to pay for it if it meant we get the extra tier points and miles (Me and my partner are both OW Sapphires but the check in agent said we won't get any of the extra benefits except for the flat beds). We politely asked for our bags to be tagged as fragile and she happily obliged and added a 'First Class' tag instead of 'Business' due to us being OW Sapphires. Requested for front row bulkhead seats and this was done with no hesitation. Overall, check in experience with Qatar Airways at LHR T4 was swift and efficient. As oneworld Sapphires, we get business class lounge and we were able to use the Skyteam Lounge which in all honesty is nothing to write about so we hang in there for an extra hour before the Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge opened. We weren't allowed to use the Qatar Airways Premium Lounge as we were non business class revenue passengers. Boarding, again very timely and efficient. After boarding, we noticed that the carpet on our seats were very wet- we weren't sure if it was vomit, juice or whatever. We spoke to the Inflight Service Manager explaining we weren't happy with the situation and she did her best to find us alternative seats and went the extra mile by finding us exit rows. My partner was not happy sitting in the middle and preferred a window seat and asked if we could go back to our original seats or get upgraded to business class which to our surpise, there was one and was happy to give it to one of us but we both decided we wanted to sit together. After take off, the Inflight Services Manager came to our row with 6 blankets to put on the wet carpet and sprayed it with a fabric freshener and gave us 2 glasses of champagne each for the inconvenience! The flight leaving late in the evening, the cabin crew swung into action to serve dinner and drinks to maximise passenger rest times. Despite what others have said on here regarding QR's inflight meal, they are honestly nothing to write about but disappointing. Small portion, dry and bland. But having eaten in the lounges, it didn't matter to us. Cabin crew were fairly stingy with drinks as well, only giving one 150 ml can unless you ask for two. Unlike other airlines such as Qantas, Cathay Pacific and American Airlines, you get a 200 mls or 330 mls sized can opended for you and get given another can! The second meal service before landing in Doha was slightly better. The pancake was delicious. Qatar Airways' IFE selection was great, I watched one movie and the rest trying to get some rest and listening to the massive selection of music albums. IFE screen was responsive though showing its age. With the overall onboard service of Qatar Airways, I find that the onboard service to be inconsistent. Whilst the Inflight Services Manager went the extra mile to make sure our flight was a comfortable one and repeatedly apologised for the inconvenience due to the wet carpet, the younger and more juinor flight attendants were dismissive and inconsistent and the onboard meals and drink service is a bit of a hit and miss.

Flights from Central Africa are derouted from KGL to DOH which cost some 2-3 hours additional flight time due to flight ban over UAE. Pre-departure drinks offered on both flights. Inflight entertainment was not working properly so had to change seat (1st flight). FA and service onboard good, but food is poorer than before. E.g. no beef or fish are available. Lamb chops appeared to be some tough meat. Drinks are fine but sparsely loaded (they ran out of 2 beer brands and remained with Heineken only). No ice-cream.

" I booked a return flight with Qatar Airways from Sydney for a family trip to France. We had a good experience on the way to Paris and at Doha airport, flying with our young children. Our return flight was a morning flight at 8:55am from CDG airport. We had checked in online the night before. Due to a series of issues at CDG airport we arrived at the check-in counter at 8:10am, late for check-in, which closes 60 minutes before the flight. I immediately attended the Qatar Airways desk, where I explained the situation to an employee. The only response I obtained was â€œyou cannot get on the flight, we will put you on the next flightâ€. There was no attempt on behalf of the employee to problem-solve or to offer us solutions to get on our flight. At my insistence, she contacted the gate staff and again stated we would not be able to board the flight. At no stage did the employee suggest that part of our travelling party could board the flight with hand luggage only as we had already checked in online. This would have been a helpful suggestion allowing us time to reorganise our luggage and take essential items. However, the employee did not have a friendly or helpful approach, seeming to just want to put us on the next flight which was 14 hours later and would cost 2200 euros in fees. This was not an option for our family. I asked if my wife and the children could board with hand luggage only. The employee replied that it was too late. I insisted that she call the gate to see if this was a possibility. She called the gate and then told us again that it was too late, that the gate closes 20 minutes prior to departure and it was now 8:30, 25 minutes prior to departure. The employee stated that it would not be possible for us to reach the gate in five minutes- again no help was offered and her attitude was bad. At this point, we discounted her advice and ran to the gate as fast as possible with our two young children. This was a difficult experience for them and they were crying. If the employee had informed us of this option even 10 minutes earlier, we would not have had to rush as much as we did. Luckily the CDG airport staff were very helpful and my wife and children were able to get on the flight with our hand luggage. I returned to the Qatar Airways desk to re-book another flight in the evening. When I checked-in in the evening, I had to deal with poor customer service again. I have contacted Qatar Airways customer service on several occasions in the past month but their responses have basically been â€˜we are very sorry about this' but they refuse to offer any compensation or explanation. I will not fly with Qatar Airways again, which is a shame because their inflight services were pretty good but the staff at Paris CDG airport were nasty.",Detractor

On the return from Casablanca to Hong Kong, it happened to hit the worst typhoon in Hong Kong, so I ended up stuck in Doha airport for 17 hours while they keep delaying the flight time. There was no support at the airport, just told the passengers to wait for a while longer and asked people to go from one service counter to another for information. When they finally decided to delay the flight for another 8 hours, it was another 1.5 hour wait for them to arrange hotel accommodation. I spent 8 hours waiting at Doha airport from 5am until 1pm.

My main purpose with this review is to provide guidance to passengers from CBR with the procedures unique to Canberra airport. Check-in opens three hours prior to departure and guidance indicates it closes one hour prior to departure, this is conducted by QANTAS staff at the far left QF check-in desks with the usual friendly, helpful assistance. The first of two security checks is conducted as if you were a regular domestic passenger. Qatar uses the QANTAS Business Class lounge for BC passengers, QANTAS Club members travelling in economy will not get access as they do not have a QF flight number. Approximately one hour prior to departure BC passengers are invited to access the international area of the airport - the length of the terminal and in Virgin territory. Having gone up another level there is the Border Force passport check (electronic for those with suitable passports) followed by the second full regime security check. The international departure gate now has limited duty free sales and coffee shop, snacks, bar facilities. In our case boarding was delayed by about 25 minutes meaning a longer than expected wait. Boarding was by class through separate desks. Onboard an allocated flight attendant explained the features of the Suite for first timers and offered a pre departure drink (only water and juices were mentioned but champagne is available if requested). After the short 30 minute hop to Sydney all passengers are required to disembark with all their carry-on. There are no further formalities at SYD, disembarkation being directly into the departures concourse",Promoter
" Edinburgh to Doha. The flight was really excellent. A very special thanks to the cabin crew member who was In charge of me in flight seat 7F, he delivered outstanding first class service, he was extremely professional and ahead of all needs to passengers, had a smile even after 7 hours into the flight. I've been flying QA for almost 10 years, although it was always a great service, but my last flight exceeded all expectations especially from the cabin crew member.",Promoter
" Cardiff to Doha via Bangkok. The opportunity of flying from my local airport to Bangkok via Doha on Qatar Airways was too good to miss. Despite officious behaviour of some Cardiff Airport staff who did their best to upset my autistic son. We opted for economy out and business back and overall were delighted, the value for money offered by economy was excellent and must put some business class offerings to shame. The business class on return was superb, the cabin staff were excellent and keen to chat with my self and my son who appreciated being treated like an adult and being allowed to choose what he wanted from the menu. The flight was full both ways so I hope this service continues despite the rough and ready ground service at Cardiff which was the exception to that we encountered elsewhere on our journey.",Promoter
" Delhi to Doha. The airline is amazing as I have been flying with Qatar airways ever since. Service was excellent, but only the exception on this trip I was disappointed that the cabin crew have chit chat with one guy for good 5-10 minutes while doing the meal service, and was not bothered that there are some passengers waiting. Given that I was seated on the last row, maybe the lady crew was thinking that it is fine to have some nice chit chat while keeping other passengers, which makes me a bit irritated. I decided to go back to sleep since i am not so sure if the lady is planning to give me my meal or not, after few minutes she tap my shoulder and asked what would I prefer for breakfast, i mentioned non-veg meal, but since she is not listening and gave me a non-veg meal.I was about to tell her but as soon as I receive my meal, the lady continued with the chitchat. I decided to just have the bread and tea. I would recommend to brief the crew to maintain to their professional image, chit chat is nice but it should not bother or affect other passengers.",Detractor
" London to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. LHR to Doha was great in A380, seat was comfortable, IFE was super but what stands out was the service by the crew. Food was alright, nothing special, but I did end up feeling rather hungry in transit. Doha-KUL was awful on A340, crammed, people wanted to sit with other family members and disrupted the seating set up for others. In the end, I was made to move because a father and his son wanted to sit together. Made to sit on aisle seat at 4 in a row. After take off, a flight attendant came to deliver and by hand luggage from where I had sat and stowed it. Nice gesture but a little bit indifferent at my displeasure at having to move from my booked seats. Uncomfortable seat, IFE temperamental. Food was okay. I would order special diet/meal next time.",Passive
" I flew from Tokyo to Casablanca via Doha and back during June and August this year. I was very impressed by the on board facilities overall. My special request for the food was approved and it was good. The flight attendants were fairly attentive and the arrival was on time almost all times. The problem was off-air when they changed the schedule 4 days before the travel, because they cancelled one flight from Casablanca to Doha in the afternoon. I had to stay in airport in Casablanca for 10 hours and no courtesies were offered for the trouble although I am a privilege club member. Overall, a great experience onboard and terrible experience off-board.",Passive
" Denpasar to Doha. Offered an upgrade to Business class, but mentioned in the fine print that this is not luggage allowance and comfort equal to a business class ticket.

" Hyderabad to Atlanta via Doha. Qatar Airways is by far the best business class product I have seen. It beats emirates and etihad hands down. The food is outstanding, cabin comfort is great, and all food is on demand. The lounge though very crowded at times in morning serves much better food than emirates. Biggest down side compared to emirates is no chauffeur drive. The lounge they use in Atlanta is club atl which is ludicrous. It would be an insult to call it a lounge.",Promoter
" First class service on both legs of the journey. From Doha to London I was fortunate to fly A350-1000. The Q-suite was amazing! The seat was comfortable to say the least, the blanket the best on any airline I've flowing and I've flown quite a few! Privacy could be obtained by closing the door, like the first class suite in Emirates first class. The service was excellent, with extremely attentive and courteous crew. Meal was good, with the option to dine at any time. Loved the entertainment on board- the selection is huge. Everything was slick and span! The coveted complimentary toiletry bag was a purple colour this time! All in all, a most wonderful flight! I would like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt thanks to the crew for a wonderful flight. Looking forward to the next one !",Promoter
" I would like to say Thank you to Qatar Airways for taking care of me and hubby during long flight from Kuala Lumpur to Paris return via Doha. It was a long journey but your staff took care of us very well. We do recommend others to please try Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways staff are really good and take care of us. They all very well deserved for appreciation. Ground Crew also very good. My fragile stuff I checked in and never broken. The ground crew was full of confidence, that their crew take care the luggage very well and got security camera every where. Food was okay. Flight was clean. Entertainment was up to date, got all new movies, TV shows and nice motivational talks. Overall I'll give 9 mark out of 10. 1 mark I cut because of food. Need to improve a bit. Thankyou once again.",Promoter
" Oslo to Melbourne via Doha. Excellent business class airline. I do a lot of business travel and have to say that some, like Qatar, are fantastic and others are not so good. The seat is big and comfortable. The service is attentive and strong. The meals were great as was the service concept - order what you want, when you want. Flights left on time, entertainment options were great - really only had positive feedback on all aspects. Had long sleeps on all flights. The business lounge in Doha airport is the best business lounge I've seen anywhere in the world, which is an added bonus. They are my airline of choice moving forward and have great reach into more minor cities in Europe than other carriers.",Promoter
" Manila to Manchester via Doha. On the 17th August, Our 2330 pm flight QR929 was canceled. This was because an accident happened a day before when Xiamen Air MF8667 skidded off the runway in a rainy thunderstorm, which led the main runway to be closed. At around 2030 pm, I went to the Main office in the terminal if our flight was canceled or not, and it was. I asked for priority accommodation because I was traveling with my immobile mother who needs rest and my son. They did not refuse as my mother is a priority passenger, and they said that they will give us accommodation also because we checked out of our condominium in Quezon City, and we had no where else to stay. The polite and very nice staff at Qatar Airways is to give us contact numbers for the new flight the next day when the runway will open, then we got on a bus to a five-star hotel that we were amazed by, which the airline paid for, not us! The next day, we get a text from the coordinator that there will be a flight at 1730 pm QR2929, we quickly packed our things and checked out. We finally got to the airport (Terminal 1) and it was shambolic, stranded passengers, crowded, with no coordination, but it was not Qatar Airways' fault, it was the airports' disappointment of not organizing this problem fluently. It took us a while for us to check-in, too crowded, especially with my disabled mom, we got through immigration, security, we finally then got to gates, In an airport, they did not have enough working boards, all of them were not working at all and we couldn't understand where to go at all, except on our ticket, our flight was supposed to depart 1730pm but we departed around 2215pm but I understand, there were too many passengers to handle though. we boarded via stairs and I complained that we did not use a lifter for catering, but that wasn't the airlines' fault though. we got into the cabin my son seated in a different row, while a sat with my mother, the seats were comfortable, the IFE was good, and the food wasn't the best but appetizing, and the staff was very helpful. We landed in Doha, and we missed our 0155 am the QR27 flight to Manchester, they gave us another flight to catch at 0810 am with no fee at all and the expectations were the same as the previous flight.",Promoter

We had a ONE WORLD logo aircraft equipped with the new QSUiTE, I had a technical problem with my seat once I put it the sleeping position it would not work again no matter what they tried it just lost all power, but other than that everything else with the flight was spotless. The IFE was superb especially in the movie selection, food was good and service was 5 star as always with Qatar Airways though the prices were very steep.",Promoter

Inflight entertainment was great and had plenty of moves to choose from however, not many new releases. All in all very, very good value for money!",Promoter
" Doha to Milan after a six hours layover at Doha Hamad Airport. I was a bit tired but not that bad, I was flying coach and I assigned myself a good window place, with just one other seat next to me as the layout was 2-4-2. I was wrong as I had under my feet the IFE box or something similar which made it so narrow. This should not be in any type of seat, but it was ok I found my space in a way to stretch my legs. My IFE was not working, just on arabic, which I donÂ´t speak and I asked for someone to help me out from the staff but after two times being ignored, I gave up and decided to something else, also If watching a film would have been a good idea. The food was ok as well the cleanliness of the aircraft was good.",Passive

" Bombay to Dallas via Doha. I traveled with Qatar many times and have no complaints about the flight and inflight service. I traveled last on 31st July and seriously those people at Mumbai check in counters were very impolite and were kind of rude with me and wife. At one point they asked me to reduce my carry on bags from 2 to 1 irrespective of it meeting the weight criteria when I asked why they replied you will be questioned in Doha that why are you carrying 2 carry-ons?

We were told, once arrived in Doha, that the customer service will take care of us upon landing, granting us lounge access and compensation which did not happen. Nobody was there at the arrival. We talked to a chain of people and found our self begging for information. At the service desk, we were given a voucher to be used for dinner and breakfast. The value was 65 QAR, we bought a pastry, an orange juice and a coffee. No place to sleep or freshen up was given. The inflight experience was okay. There was a good amount of entertainment choice. Food tasted and I personally did not like food being served almost halfway through the flight but that's just a personal preference.",Detractor
 Nagpur to Atlanta via Doha. This is much better than other airlines internationally. The staff is very helpful and polite. I feel very safe when traveling in Qatar airways.

" Vienna to Bangkok via Doha. I had great expectations from their service and quality of product they would offer. And in the overall situation they did a good job, but there were some little details which were not acceptable. Vienna Check in I was served by staff that did not care about me and she was doing the procedures during my check-in while talking with her colleagues next to her. I asked if she was aware that I had a short time in Doha, and after the second time she put me on the backpack the ""fast track"" stripe. I was flying their new Boeing 787, which is really an incredible product, everything is new and really clean. I was really impressed from the seats, they were really comfortable, and I had plenty of legroom. The service of the first breakfast was excellent, they provided everything quickly and good, but the in flight snack was kinda strange, I asked what were the options, and it was a meat, chicken curry or vegetable sandwich. I wanted to try the second one, but I asked which kind of vegetables were inside, and the answer was to try it and you will discover it. I enjoyed the ife product on board a lot, with the personalized remote control in each seat. Also the toilet, had a nice touch such as the hand lotion and the parfume, like 15 years ago or in some business class products, it was a kind of old school touch that I liked a lot!",Passive
" Boston to Trivandrum via Doha. The service at the airport and the ground crew and all were excellent. However the flight attendant we got was horrible, she didn't really do anything we expect from the airline. Food was poorly given, our daughter didn't get a toy usually given in the beginning.While this one was useless, I was able to get the attention of another attendant who was really nice and helpful.

" Doha to Milan. A red eye flight fully booked , the aircraft was a bit old with the Qatar Airways old configuration in Business Class but the service was still superb they offered a light dinner and full breakfast, I enjoyed the dinner but skipped the breakfast, too many calories, though the same problem is faced on all Qatar Airways flights, movies are always up to date but TV shows are old . This is the high season for Qatar Airways and their tickets are on the pricey side. As an older aircraft there was no WiFi offered.",Promoter
" When I made the online booking the flight was pretty empty so I booked a window and aisle seat for my partner and, with an empty seat in the middle. When We checked in at BKK, we were told that they had put someone in the middle seat. I asked why, was the flight full? They said it wasn't full but we're filling the cabin for â€˜safety reasons'. We asked if there was anywhere else on the plane where we could have an empty seat between us. They said no. When we got on the plane it was less than half full and there were empty rows everywhere! So why did we have to go through that at checkin. The flight was delayed for 2 hours for a technical reason. I found the food inedible. Lots of completion so won't fly them again.",Detractor
" Was looking forward to the privacy and comfort of my flight from Bangkok to Doha on the A380. But what a disappointment upon checking in at BKK airport. Qatar has three flights to Doha in the evening. One flight was cancelled, one delayed by 3 hours and my flight downsized from A380 to 777. Needless to say that my pre-booked seat was gone and I had to endure with a leftover seat for the next 7 hours. Flight was 100% full due to the other cancelled flight. 777 not nearly as comfortable as the A380 in terms of space, comfort, noise and dryness of the air. Service was average and rushed. Lounge at Doha airport very crowded as always during peak hours. I left after a while because lines even for the toilets were building up. They should really consider getting another lounge. Flight from Doha to Helsinki was much better on the smaller and reasonably comfortable B788. Overall, one flight below average, and the other good.",Passive
" Munich to Tokyo via Doha. This is the first time I write a review on an airline, but I have to. I have been flying a fair bit over the years and I haven't had a service like that before. Qatar Airways staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They are helpful with the food, explaining well what they have on offer. They are happy to prepare you a drink that cannot just be poured out of a bottle, like my gin and tonic yesterday. They keep coming with water and juice throughout the flight every 30 minutes or so. I have never seen this on a long flight before. They are still friendly and heap it up for you. Even more surprising is the state of the toilets. I'd almost feel sorry for the crew if I hadn't paid a fair amount of money for my flight. They are still clean one or two hours before landing. Thank you for this great experience.",Promoter

Then had a 2 hour layover in my favorite airport Hamad International, then boarded my flight to Munich on the A350-900. When I boarded the A350 I was amazed how spacious it was, both the 777 & A350 were Comfortable, but the A350 was more comfortable. The new Oryx Inflight entertainment is amazing and is very easy to use, Cabin Crew were very friendly on the second flight too, meal was excellent, there were 2 meals served on this 5 hour 40 minutes flight - first meal was a snack sandwich which tasted good, second meal was a main course breakfast, was delicious! They Were offering juices and water every 30 minutes with a nice smile, I'd like to Thank them! The seat legroom was generous, Amenity Kit was handed during boarding in Economy Class.

I was in the middle of a 3 seat combination, my husband on one side and a larger (wide) man on the other who decided that sitting for the whole flight with his legs wide open and his body taking a 1/3 of my seat made the flight very awkward. This is too close for comfort. When the food was served it was hard to make out what the food was - there was a croissant with one of meals, it was so shriveled up. Scrambled eggs with some dreadful sauce on it, other food offerings I found to be poor. My husband is 6'3"" so when fellow passenger in front reclined his seat the space became impossible.

My last flights onboard of A350 from Adelaide to Doha and A380 from Doha to Melbourne were absolutely fantastic.

 Travelled in Qatar First class (Doha to Perth). I am a gold member in Emirates but has decided to change carrier and tried Qatar Airways. I was not disappointed. In flight service in first is excellent. Crew were extremely friendly and clearly wanted to give a five star experience to their customers. Doha first class lounge is the best I have been. No doubt they have won a lot of awards. You need to travel with them to appreciate their superb service. A380 first class lacks as much privacy as in emirates but the seat and service makes up for all that. There are only 8 seats and crew give total attention and makes the journey one of the most memorable.,Promoter
" Adelaide to Doha. The seats are not designed for tall people. Standing at 196cm (6'5) I couldn't lay down straight in the bed.

" Zurich to Clark via Doha. It was my first time on Qatar's A359 and I can't help but notice the improvements in its new economy class product. Seat pitch was superb, and much more spacious than its Dreamliner counterpart. The new Thales entertainment system was intuitive, but the selection pales in comparison with Emirates. The gray seats provided a contrast with the maroon seat covers. While the Dreamliner economy was OK, it pales in comparison with the A359's. My only gripe with this particular A359 was that the WCs seem clunky, especially for a new aircraft. One was out of order, while the order had a broken toilet seat. As usual, Qatar's inflight service is commendable. Attendants were very responsive, courteous, and pleasant. Drinks were frequently offered, which is a practice that I would like to see in other airlines. On the DOH-CRK leg, a flight attendant was concerned that my preferred dinner from the menu was unavailable (I was on one of the last rows served), and so she made sure that I get the first pick for breakfast. These little things leave a lasting impression. I've been on a lot of trips, including many with QR, and I can't remember a time where the FAs go this extra. And of course, flying with QR will likely take you on a layover at DOH - the best airport in the Middle East. Good things aside, the flight out of ZRH was delayed for more than half an hour, which means that my almost two-hour transit time at DOH would be cut short. It wasn't the airline's fault, but it was a good call on their part to dock at a remote gate at DOH and ferry the passengers via bus directly to the transit security check. Unfortunately my checked in luggage did not make the transfers.",Promoter
"  Perth to Paris via Doha. Absolutely amazing flights, both legs of the Perth to Paris trip were excellent. We were traveling with two kids and an infant, the cabin crew could not do enough for us.

I have not had true hospitality like this aboard any other airline. Thoroughly impressed and cannot wait to fly again.",Promoter
" We have never experienced such amazing service on any airline. The cabin service is outstanding - friendly and supremely efficient but never intrusive. Wonderful food beautifully served and every kind of drink you can think of! The airport in Doha is like a five-star hotel and the assisted passenger service puts Heathrow and Edinburgh to shame. We had a transfer time of just over an hour between our flights and our suitcases were waiting at the carousel when we arrived. A great improvement on last year's experience from Heathrow to Edinburgh when we had four hours between flights and British Airways only managed to deliver one of our suitcases 36 hours later! The Boeing 787 is a great aircraft but we preferred the cabin layout of the Boeing 777. We will definitely choose Qatar over any other airline in future. My husband needs a wheelchair so travel can be a bit stressful but I can honestly say, this was the best flight we have ever experienced and we have been flying between South Africa and the UK for 50 years!!

" Melbourne to Madrid via Doha. First time on Qatar Airways and they were good. I usually fly Singapore Airlines but my travel partner was a One World flyer so we tried Qatar. Seating on the A380 is very comfy with loads of legroom and what felt like a slightly wider seat than on Singapore Airlines. Crew were lovely on both flights though bar/food service was a bit slow and we had quite a wait. No drinks cart to start with like Singapore Airlines and the food wasn't all that wonderful but compensated for by the spaciousness and the crew themselves. IFE was good though movie list not as extensive as I expected. Crew from DOH to MAD were particularly friendly, professional and they made the flight a real pleasure.",Passive
"  Qatar Airways are a fantastic airline, but the Boeing 787 is awful and I would avoid this aircraft. The seats are very narrow with a 3-3-3 configuration and being in a centre seat it was a very tight squeeze for 5.5hrs (I'm not overly large, 175cm, 78kg). On sitting down it felt as if the seat had no padding and was extremly hard. The crew were lovely, the food was OK and we certainly didn't feel tired on arrival due to the 787 but what a squeeze. Such a small, hard seat- fortunately we had amazing flights on their A380 to/from Australia to compensate.",Passive

" Kuwait to Cape Town via Doha. I am stuck in an airport lounge in Nairobi. A seemingly routine flight from Kuwait to Cape Town has turned into this three day fiasco. On 8th June I booked in as per normal at Kuwait Int Airport. Proceeded to the departure gates and waited to board the plane. The flight at first was delayed, no announcement or information was given. Only when fellow travelers started to get annoyed about the situation did Qatar staff try to explain. We were to sit and wait, .no explanation. After 2 hours of waiting we were told there are technical issues with the plane. Again told to just wait. Another hour passed and we were told to go the transfer desk, massive confusion at the transfer desk as the staff did not know what was going on. Again we were told to wait, then two options, we wait till they fix the aircraft or take the next flight the next morning. I was then booked on a flight to Nairobi and was told all has been taken care of and that I will be connected with the next flight from Nairobi to Cape Town. Only to arrive in Nairobi and nothing of such was done. The crew in Kuwait did not issue the ticket correctly which led to the crew in Nairobi not being able to issue me with the connecting ticket, making me miss the last flight out to Cape Town. Then I was told failing that they can put me on a flight from Nairobi to JNB and then to CPT. That was 4 hours ago, no one informs or keep one updated. Turns out I won't be on the flight to JNB. I will be booked into a hotel and put on the first flight out in the morning? I am disappointed with this airline. There was no attempt to rectify, or defuse the situation... I have to constantly have to ask what is happening etc. Who knows where my luggage is at this point of time.",Detractor
" Houston to Bangkok via Doha, the two flights in Q Suites were the best business class I have ever experienced. Check in at IAH terminal D is not in an ideal location. First impression, chaos. There were plenty of staff greeting passengers and getting each customer to an agent, turning chaos into order. The agent made eye contact and focused on getting me on my way. Their lounge is shared with several carriers. Food included vegetarian options was not bad. The seating is just okay. The flight was delayed due to the aircraft arriving later. Announcements were audible and clear in the gate area. Boarding was special. US ICE agents lined the jetway asking questions and making us feel really special. A flight attendant at the door showed me to my seat and offered a pre-departure drink. Crew appearance was sharp and professional. Sincere smiles lead me to believe they enjoy their jobs. Qatar offers dinning on demand in business class. I choose to eat right after departure to sleep on this 14 hour flight. My meal was special order vegetarian and was fresh and good, not great. I enjoyed a Grand Cru Pauillac. The Flight Attendant offered turn down service and he draped my seat with light bedding. In flat sleeping position the seat is wide and has generous width including space for my feet. I was able to sleep 9 hours in peace with the suite door closed. The space inside my suite was more than ample. Easy storage of all personal items. The IFE Screen is large and HD noise cancelling head phones are provided. I didn't find the selection up to the tech, but you can upload files to play using USB or near field connections. Service was friendly and prompt throughout the flight. The Flight Attendants could not have been better. Hamed Airport Doha is a very modern facility and the lounge and transit experience was easy and comfortable.",Promoter
" Flew Washington to Doha. Check in was smooth, unfortunately Qatar Airways use Turkish Airlines Business Class lounge at Dulles which is very small and crowded, I could not sit in it. I had an aisle seat on this flight which was not as nice as the window seats on my outbound flight, Qsuites are the most comfortable seats in business class I have ever used and Qatar Airways have the best service I have experienced. Food was alright, not as good as the catering service out of Doha. WIFI worked on part of the flight but not all, it was just good enough to use WhatsApp. The IFE on QSuites is better than the one offered on the A350 and much more user friendly arrival in Doha was on time.",Promoter

The food was way above my expectations. The extremely long flight between Auckland and Doha was as comfortable as it could have been. Qatar Airways would certainly be my airline of choice in future. The return journey with Singapore Airlines (again booked at short notice and with very limited seat availability) was sadly well below the standards set during my outward trip.",Promoter

Boarding which was fast and the amazing Qsuite 3K which was really good - a nice seat, amazing tv, brilliant and innovative. A welcome drink was given but the last drink, before take off staff came and asked for my dinner, she said in 15 mins we serve you since you ordered online. The cabin crew takes 1 hr 15 mins to make my table afterwords, they serve chickpeas that were cold - I told them I do not need dinner and remove the table cloth. On arriving a lady who is in charge comes to say sorry we could not serve you food, I hope you had a wonderful flight.",Detractor

No smile from staff when boarding and most staff I saw did not seem very happy or friendly., some were okay.

However, if you expect to select a seat when booking your ticket with them and actually flying on that seat, forget it. They push you back on the cabin for whatever excuse. Why allow you to select a seat when booking the flight if you will never honour it at check-in? I fly with them to Doha for work every other month but I guess this May 2018 will be the last. Great aircraft and facilities and very good crew but atrocious check-in personnel at LHR (polite but useless) and the worst customer service team I have ever experienced.",Passive
" I flew on upgraded business class on Qatar Airways from Shanghai to Stockholm via Doha (return). What a treat!! The entire experience was amazing. The service on board is impeccable. You couldn't really compare it to other airlines' business class. It is definitely better than BA first class experience. Since my class was an upgraded one, I didn't have access to the Al Mourjan lounge at DOH. But I got access to it since the other lounges were full on my first transfer. On my second transfer, I purchased access to Al Mourjan (450 QAR = 125 USD). It was worth every penny since my layover was more than 5 hours. My last leg Doha to Shanghai was in a Q-suite on a B777. Amazing. I loved it and I loved the service. I can't even imagine how Qatar Airways manages to maintain this level of service. It's really a treat for ones soul and body. Many people complain about the lost access to the Al Mourjan lounge on upgraded tickets. Of course its a shame not to spend the layover at that lounge but considering the quality of the food and drinks you get at that lounge, I think QR went back on me paying the 125 USD entrance fee.",Promoter
" Denpasar to Paris via Doha. Overall a very good experience. First flight from Bali to Doha on the 777 was with their old business class offering. Seats are big and comfortable, however are angled flat beds and not completely flat. Travelling with my partner and a toddler the seat was wide enough for my son to sleep beside me which was a huge bonus. Food on this flight was excellent along with an excellent cabin service from the staff on board. I did not use the entertainment system and slept for most of the 10 hour flight so cannot comment on this. The second leg from Doha to Paris was again on a 777 but this time we had the QSuite. Having flown on many different carriers business offering this is by far the best I have seen. We took the 2 centre seats which when converted to flat created a double bed. Having this when travelling with a young child was a huge help. The suites offer maximum privacy and create a sense that you are flying alone. Seats are very comfortable, IFE excellent with large HD screen and lots of viewing options. Food again was very good with lots of options to choose from. Once again the staff were some of the best I have experienced in the sky and nothing was too much trouble for them. Overall Qatar offer probably the best business product I have flown and would not hesitate to book them again. The others have some catching up to do.",Promoter

" Adelaide to Manchester via Doha. Two flights which could not have been more different. Adelaide to Doha on A350, comfortable and spacious seats, good entertainment system and fantastic crew. Also pre selected vegetarian meals which were very acceptable. Crew on this flight were attentive, smiling and courteous all the way. Doha to Manchester on Boeing 787 was cramped, uncomfortable with terrible entertainment system and miserable crew. On boarding this flight the crew were directing passengers down the wrong aisles causing frustration and back ups. During the flight they appeared tired and uninterested with little customer interaction. Probably one of the worst flights I've had with this usually excellent airline.",Passive
" The departure from Kuwait was delayed by 1 hour. Crew apologized for the delay but this reduced my time in exploring Al-Mourjan lounge in Doha. From Doha to Singapore neither the map or onboard camera were working on the A350. Crew on both sectors were fabulous, however, IFE and seat comfort (1x2x1 layout) is a joke. Wi-Fi was unavailable for my flight to Singapore. On the way back to Kuwait my seat IFE was malfunctioning so they changed my prefer preassigned seat to another seat, thus causing me inconvenience.

Before boarding my flight from Doha to Singapore, I asked if my luggage is on the flight but the person on the counter scolded me for holding on to my husband's flight ticket saying that he should hold it himself cause I might lose it.

On the leg from Doha to Ho Chi Minh the seats were worse - again the staff were exceptional. The meals on both legs of the journey were catered for a certain pallet type which is expected but not helpful.

" Doha to Bangkok was one of the best flights ever I had. I was already knowing the cabin of The Boeing 787, so the space was as usual pretty nice and ok. The food was really spicy and full of ingredients so I did not touch it too much. The cabin crew was really patient, polite, and they were really helpful in curating the details, from each guests. It turne out that I forgot my amenity kit at home. As it was a night flight, I asked a member from the cabin crew and she said there were not any available in economy anymore, but she gave the chance to have one from Business class, which I was just in love because of the Brics design. She was so polite, and talented and she was just four months with Qatar Airways, she really made my flight and all my 24h journey.

" Edinburgh to Bangkok via Doha. Excellent service, which I have now come to expect from Qatar. They outshine in almost every aspect. One gripe however, is the check in at Edinburgh, which may be managed by One World. This was seriously bad. It took 30 minutes to check in, with 2 passengers in front of me. The staff seem to have no experience in checking passengers in, and they were constantly transferring priority luggage tags, lounge invitations etc between two desks, as if there was no preparation. We were then informed that there was no Fast Track (FT) for security clearance, but when we pointed out to the gate keeper that we were members of OneWorld, they allowed us to proceed through FT. Not sure why Qatar is not listed as a user of FT for its Business Class travellers. Onboard service was impeccable, with professional, efficient and pleasant staff, which is truly noteworthy. Wifi connectivity did not appear to work on the several times I attempted to use it.",Promoter

" Hong Kong to Dublin via Doha. An evening service using Boeing 777 on first leg and Boeing 787 from Doha. Check-in was quick and efficient in both airports. Seat 3K (right window) on B777 was comfortable and spacious. Flight attendants were friendly, and addressed me by name. Qatar offer dining on demand, and my excellent dinner arrived when requested. From the menu, lobster stood out, but it was not available. The FA saw my disappointment, and twice during the flight the purser came to apologise. The beef replacement was excellent. Food overall was probably the best I have had on an airplane. Wine was also really good. Couldn't fault the service, with a nice amenity kit, including Georgio Armani after shave balm, after shave, and lots of moisturisers, lip balm etc. Pyjamas are also supplied and it was easy to get 6 hours good sleep. IFE was good, with a reasonable selection, and an excellent moving map display, including simulated head-up display and instrument panel. First leg arrived on time, and then all change to the Boeing 787. Service on to Dublin was of a similar standard, and the breakfast omelette, which came after a nice fruit selection and cereal, was very tasty. The interesting thing here is the comparison between the B777 and 787. The 787's seat (2K window seat), is angled so you have no-one beside you. The Boeing 787 windows are just huge, and are electronically dimmed. Cabin lighting is very sophisticated, but I have to say that overall I was a little disappointed with the Boeing 787. The seat is not as spacious or comfortable as the older 777, and the IFE is decidedly fiddly and unfriendly to use. I could see several passengers needing assistance with it, and the FA's couldn't figure it out either. The moving map display was different also, and strangely for a newer airplane, it was much more basic, and missed most of the nice features available on the 777. Overall, I have to say that Qatar offer an incredibly good service, with amazing food, great staff, a modern fleet, and very comfortable lounges, particularly in Doha. I would seek them out actively in preference to the other middle eastern airlines, and that is really saying something.",Promoter
" Birmingham to Manila via Doha. Check in at Birmingham was very quick and easy and was given fast track security, although in Birmingham this is pretty badly organised! The lounge is a 3rd party lounge called No.1, which is quite nice and modern inside and with reasonable amount of seating tables etc. Because it is a lounge which you can pay to use they limit how much hot food you can have which is a shame as the portions are not large, although it was actually delicious. Boarding was easy and quick and my amenity kit was already in my seat and I was immediately offered a welcome drink. All crew on board were fantastic throughout the flight. Food and drinks including presentation was more akin to a first class product really. The seat in the 787 is the excellent herringbone config and was very comfortable and with a lot of storage and table space. At Doha I did not have long to change planes so did not have time to enjoy the lounge. On the 777 the service was just as excellent, I didn't sample the dinner as I went straight to sleep but the breakfast was excellent and the dine in demand meant that it could fit around when I woke up and I wanted to eat, an amazing plus! The 777 was an older one with the old 2-2-2 config which actually isn't too bad, the seat and bed are both comfortable although as I am quite tall I much prefer a seat with a separate food stool. There is fairly good storage space although limited table space. Regarding IFE, whilst the 787 has a newer system, I actually found the 777 system more responsive and easier to use and the quality was still really good! Overall an outstanding flight and very good value for money. Being able to collect BA points and avios was an added bonus.",Promoter
" Johannesburg to Edinburgh via Doha. Qatar Airways provides a decent service with their flights, but other areas are lacking. You can choose your seats online if you booked with them, which is useful without paying an extra charge. The seats were too narrow in my opinion and leg room was not too generous. Service by the cabin staff was good. The in flight entertainment was okay. Some recent new movies were the highlight. The screen is not very high quality and headphones supplied had to have its connection moved around to work properly, which was not a good experience at all and this happened on my recent flights with them. I was disappointed with the food quantities and frequency. The main meals for breakfast and supper (somehow never got lunch) are very small, notwithstanding that there are some other small accompaniments. The choices of were only basically chicken or vegetarian. The problem that I had with how often meals were served was particularly on one of my connecting flights to Doha, which started boarding at 12:45. They did not serve lunch and instead served supper at 16:00 and in the evening, they only served their tiny hot sandwich, which is a small rectangular pie and a tiny cupcake. As a result, I was very hungry throughout the flight. On arrival to my final destination, my suitcase was also damaged, with two sharp metal parts sticking out from the bottom and when I inquired about it at the baggage desk, they refused to even acknowledge that there was any damage and were quite frankly rude.

" My wife and I had booked a return trip Adelaide to Frankfurt via Doha over Easter. A few days before departure Qatar offered an upgrade to Business Class for the 2 legs and we decided to upgrade for about $2500 for Adelaide Doha. This was well worth it, we ate well, our Romanian our flight attendant was excellent and attended to our every need and I managed to sleep about 9 hours. The next leg, Doha to Frankfurt was only 6 hours and it passed uneventfully but in Economy Class. Our return flight, about 12 days later from Frankfurt to Doha passed quickly as well. On the nearly 14 hour flight from Doha to Adelaide we each had a row of seats. The A350 which Qatar uses for the 14 hours long haul, has a 3x3x3 configuration which made sleeping possible. But economy class food left a lot to be desired. I was served lamb in apricot sauce which was so dry that I think they forgot about the sauce. For the brunch I opted for the Cheddar Cheese scrambled egg and this was also very dry . However, the desserts served were of a good enough standard.

The ground staff made no announcements about the delay for over two hours. They only made one when I finally trudged up to the small, packed, outdated gate area and told them they needed to. Then, a chaotic boarding commenced that was a free-for-all. In DOH, I missed my connection by a half hour or so. There was no ground staff there with information on my flight to Kigali, I had to go to their transfer desk to get vouchers for the stay in Doha.

" Booked a 15 day day food tour of India, starting from New Delhi and ending up at Goa, Qatar Airways offered the best route.

The passenger next but one to me, was argumentative as he did not get his food choice as well, she handled the situation extremely well. She explained to the passenger that number of food choice is governed by projected demand and supply. This happened to me again from Goa to Doha, again the cabin crew was apologetic and and showed empathy. From Doha to Manchester, luckily I was seated near the front and therefore had choice of food, and they provided numerous drinks run throughout the flight. I would give this airline 10 out of 10, but only going got give it 8 out of 10 due to not having my choice of food.

Seat has power outlet to charge your gadgets or laptops , Qatar airways even provide customers with Laptop on demand if u want during your journey. I got one as I had to finish one presentation. Food can be made to order and you can choose your own time of having it. They had varieties of beverages. I had a good nights sleep with fully flat bed and ambient lighting. Had a great breakfast.

" Flew Qatar Airways from Oslo to Doha. The business cabin on the B787 planes is at the front of the plane, since there is no first class. At the second door a small onboard self-service bar is in place where champagne, wine and snacks are provided during the flight. Two additional seats can be found behind the bar and between the toilets, these are not recommended. Due to the small cabin (compared to the A380 cabins) the atmosphere is much warmer and the staff can pay more attention to passengers. The overhead compartments are missing above the middle seats that makes the cabin more spacious, but middle seat passengers must use the storage above the window seats. Usually it is not a problem, the space is still enough, but I felt uncomfortable in disturbing others by opening the storage above them. The 1-2-1 herringbone configuration seats provide great comfort and space, they are like first class seats at some other airlines. They can be converted to a full-flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited. The screen is large enough and the noise cancellation headsets close out every disturbance. Since it was a day flight, pajamas were only available upon request. The service was excellent and Qatar Airways' on-demand a'la carte menu allows passengers to meal whenever and whatever they wish. Before take-off the flight attendants book the meal requests and the preferred time of the serving, then they return when time comes. Of course passengers can change their mind anytime but it is worth booking the meals in advance to ensure they do not run out. In my case they ran out of Hungarian desert wine Tokaji but substituted with an Australian one. The meals were delicious, but not show-stopping. The entertainment system could have a bigger selection of movies and the browsing the selection should be available via the main screen instead of the touch screen equipped remote control. WiFi is for free up to 10MB (!) more can be purchased, however it is really slow and occasionally working.",Promoter
" Flew Qatar Airways from Doha to Sydney. The business class cabin is situated on the upper deck of the A380, behind the first class cabin. The seats are in a herringbone configuration of 1-2-1. They are very comfortable and can be converted to a full flat bed, however some may find the leg space limited in the bed position. But still, they are well ahead of most business seats of other airlines. The onboard service was excellent and smooth. Passengers can select when, what and how many times they wish their meals to be served. It is a nice thing, but it means that people eat in different times, hence the flight attendants run up and down the cabin during the whole flight and smell of food is always present in the cabin. At the aft of the business cabin a full size bar can be found with canopies, fruit and a bartender who serves cocktails. It is simply amazing! The WiFi is free up to 10Mb, but it did not really work to me and the selection of movies could be wider.",Promoter

" Doha to Atlanta. When checking in in Atlanta despite telling the agent we were going to stop in Doha she checked our bags to Kathmandu. The agent had to have her supervisor correct the error. The same happened in Kathmandu despite my very clear instructions that we were going to Doha. When I saw that incorrect bag tags had been printed she was quite rude telling me that I should have told her that we were only going to Doha. Doha airport has been built to a very high standard, there is a train to take passengers to the gates, however arriving passengers must walk to the terminal. Admittedly almost everyone on both flights into Doha were in transit. We were not. The passport process was very poor. At least an hour wait on both occasions. There are 36 immigration gates, of which no more than five were manned. After the first stay in Doha we found the check-in process for our flight to Kathmandu relatively simple. I'm OneWorld sapphire member, and the process worked OK. Qatar Airways has a lounge that permits entry to OneWorld members and we were able to enjoy a breakfast before joining the flight to Kathmandu. After the second stay in Doha we had to checkin at a special area for passengers travelling to the USA. We later learnt on return to the US that our miles from Doha to Atlanta did not appear in our AA accounts. Of the 45 minutes we expected to have in the Qatar Airways lounge to have breakfast we had just 20 minutes before we were called to the gate. Passengers with computers or iPads were sent to a special security area and devices checked and placed in sealed plastic bags which could not be opened until on board the aircraft. My wife's iPad is in a very tightly fitting leather protective case. The security people insisted that this had to be removed which proved very difficult. The leather case was never examined and just returned to her, so what that proved I have no idea. All this additional security meant that the flight departed Doha late and in turn arrived late in Atlanta. The food on Qatar Airways is very basic. I was unimpressed with Qatar Airways and next year when we visit Bhutan we will use a different OneWorld carrier.",Detractor
" 25 hour delay and no compensation. I have been flying with them for 10 years and I'm a part of the Privilege Club Program. Due to technical problems, my flight from Jakarta to Warsaw via Doha was delayed, so I was redirected to Brussels but Qatar Airways forgot to book me the further flight to Warsaw, which led to my 25 hours late arrival in Warsaw. My destination was PoznaÅ„, I had to change the ticket 3x and pay the extra costs. In Brussels, representatives of Qatar Airways told us that all costs associated with our travel will be compensated by Qatar Airways. After describing the events and sending them to the given address, they advised that the Regulation EC261 is not applicable, and does not apply to Non-European Carriers' flights to the EU.",Detractor
" Return flight to Copenhagen via Doha. Really impressed with the lounge in Bangkok, quiet, clean and excellent service. Qatar A380 business has to be my favorite aircraft, so quiet and comfortable. Boeing 787 to Copenhagen was full, I don't like this cabin compared to that of both the 380 and 350 - I feel you are more â€˜exposed' even though it's the same seat and the 787 is by far a noisier aircraft. One area where Qatar needs to improve is the food, it was abysmal on both sectors, the offering from Doha was disgusting. The crew were fine, but I find few crew engaging until the end of the flight where they â€˜have' to ask if your flight was enjoyable, it seems staged.",Passive
" Melbourne to Dublin via Doha. Booked flight that morning due to family emergency, couldn't afford any delays. Well 52 hours later I arrived in Ireland. QR905 delayed due to mechanical ex Melbourne, no info from QR, relied on Qantas lounger updates, probably a visit from uniformed QR staff to lounge would have been in order, finally boarded 3 hours late which meant missed connecting flight to LHR. QR had me overnighting in hotel to take direct flight DOH-DUB next day, however after much debate with ground team they put me on another flight to LHR 6 hours later, which that ended up delayed, would have missed connecting flight to DUB so full circle and I went to hotel and took direct flight next day. Transfers all arranged and voucher for meals, can't fault the disruption service. Service on MEL -DOH was average, no interaction from the male FA. Service can border on robotic, very impersonal. Seat comfortable, like the lounge behind business class, great place to stretch out. I found the cabin too hot,Wifi very slow and patchy, the free MB goes in seconds. Flexible airfare so premium price paid. QR still far superior to majority of other airlines, just need to improve the ground staff support, will continue to fly with them.",Passive
" Johannesburg to Houston via Doha. Ground Crew not friendly. Allowed 2 suitcases at 23kg and one carry on. We only had one checked baggage and one carry on each, so below by one checked baggage. Because my CPAP bag was temporary on top of the Carry on they wanted me to pay extra. I explained that I can take my Medical bag off and an argument by the staff started. Eventually a Supervisor intervened and commonsense kicked in. The crew onboard were far from friendly except for the JNB to DOH that flight was as all flights should be, friendly and with good friendly service. Entertainment screen was only 8 inches away from my face. Most of the time my entertainment system didn't work by the Touch Screen or by the Hand Control. Main food meal was tasty and good but snack food tasted awful. Water was regularly offered throughout all flights.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha. This was a pleasant trip with Qatar Airways. All the cabin crew members were friendly and attentive. Plenty of drinks were offered, and when we asked for anything the crew went the extra mile to fulfil our wishes. One of our B773ER planes and the A330 still had the old Oryx One entertainment system with a low-resolution screen - the newer entertainment systems on the other planes were excellent! Especially the flight in their B787 was very comfortable, even in economy class. The A330 cabin was rather dated, they should retrofit these planes with newer seats. The food was excellent compared to other economy products. Transfer in Doha was smooth. The only issue on this trip were the rude and incompetent local airport ground staff at SGN who conducted check-in for Qatar Airways: they enforced the weight limits for baggage down to the last gram, as strictly as for any low-cost carrier. I canâ€˜t imagine Qatarâ€˜s own staff to be that stringent on weight limits.",Promoter
" This was my first long haul economy flight in a decade. After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn't complete torture. It's up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I'd say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don't have access to the regular business class lounge but a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn't matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it's open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it's economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I'll be seeking out again. No matter how you dress it up economy is economy.",Passive
" Barcelona to Melbourne via Doha. Plane, we have now flown twice on 787's and each time it has been a disappointment. The seats feel cramped and narrow when compared to the A380 which is flown in the second leg. The entertainment system is difficult to navigate and the volume is particularly difficult to control. The seats are difficult to move from reclined back straight. 5/10 Service was ok but not at the top of the market when compared to Singapore, Cathay or even Qantas. I wished to change the food order for the children but the hostess made only a brief attempt to find alternative meals and then never came back to let me know definitively that no meals were available. 5/10 Food: Very average meals, serves are small and generally would advise steering clear of European style meals. Indian meals taste better. 5/10 Overall disappointing compared to competitors.",Passive
" Copenhagen to Bangkok via Doha. These two flights had both good and bad. Copenhagen to Doha, the seat on the 787 is far superior to that of the old style seat on some 777. However the food was bad , the chicken was inedible and the crew were noisy in the galley. The lounge experience in Doha was again, exemplary. The staff are so friendly and the waiter service and a la carte menu impressive. Boarding for the BKK sector was a bit of a scrum, they could make the priority lane more prominent. It was literally a case of pushing through passengers trying to board. Doha-Bangkok sector and the crew couldn't have been more different from their colleagues on the Copenhagen sector. For such an early morning departure they were friendly and had a genuine warmth. Food was much better, supper was delivered speedily after take off, and the pancakes for breakfast were delicious. The one thing that lets down QR on the old 777 are the seats, it was uncomfortable to sleep on, but I was so tired I managed a few hours. All in all though a much more positive experience than my previous flights with QR.",Promoter

Cannot say enough about Qatar customer service and Cabin crew. A great airline who want to continually improve by listening to customers.

" Kigali to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha on 27-28 Febr. 2018. Punctual flights, uneventful. 3 hours scheduled additional time delay avoiding overflying Saudia Arabia. FAs are excellent â€“ world-class. Annoying announcements â€“ many of them superfluous. They continue their charity propaganda for Educate a Child â€“ that really puzzles me. How naÃ¯ve are we passengers to blindly support financially some glossy outlayed institution without providing neutral facts? The 2nd flight left 02 a.m. and did hardly have any food for business class. No real hot dishes â€“ no fish, no meat, only cold piece salmon was offered. They offered a beef filet which was only a spoon of rice with some shredded meat in a heavy brown sauce. No chilli, no fishsauce, no ginger, no icecream, no nothing. I was only saved by an alert FA who managed to secure me a reasonable meal of fish from economy class. Never experienced this before when travelling in business class. Seats in these A330 aircraft are lie flat but narrow that your feet are squeezed if stretching the legs out into a tiny hole under the seat in front. Paid by far too much for this ticket.

" London to Melbourne via Doha. I found an excellent fare with Qatar so I had to give them a go. My flight from London was delayed by nearly 2 hours, however when I checked in I was offered to be moved to the earlier flight (which was about to board).

As someone who is only 5ft 10 I had more than enough room on the second leg. Service is generally very good, however the food and drink selections are a little basic compared to Emirates, offering only Red label scotch, Smirnoff vodka and Beefeater gin. Food was just okay. The IFE was good, without being great, offering largely B-list films with 2 or 3 blockbusters. Qatar offers 10 minutes/10mb of free WiFi which is basically enough to check your Twitter, then 30 minutes for $6USD. It's a nice touch, but very steep compared to Emirates flight long Wi-Fi for $1USD. Overall, if bad scotch and average movies don't bother you, Qatar is for you. Easily my new second favourite airline.",Promoter

They made people wait for 5 hours, did not have any game plan to provide accommodation when we got back to Doha (they took us back).

" Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha. I travelled along with my 4 months old son and my mother on Jan 22nd. First I need to tell about my bad experience with other airlines then only you will understand my wonderful experience with Qatar Airways. We booked online to travel on Jan 21st from Canton, Ohio to Chicago through American Airlines, from Chicago to Hyderabad via Doha but AA flight got delayed for several hours and they don't know how much time it takes, they were keep on changing AA flight time, later we realized it's impossible to catch connecting flight in Chicago (we already wasted several hours while waiting), so we discussed with AA staff, they took almost 4 hours and finally they said we have to rebook tickets to next day and they cannot rebook through Qatar but said they can rebook with BA (British Airways) for next day ie. Jan 22nd from Cleveland to Chicago through AA flight and from Chicago to India through BA flight. I agreed for that because we don't have any other feasible options at that time. On Jan 22nd we were able to flew from Cleveland to Chicago in AA flight but in Chicago BA staff did not allow me to board in BA flight because they said I don't have unexpired US visa (I already have H4 approval petition but don't have unexpired US visa and already scheduled for visa appointment in India). I did not know that I need a visa to travel in BA and AA staff who changed our entire itinerary (it supposed to be with Qatar Airways but changed to BA) never told us about visa restrictions with BA even though we spent 4 hours in their counter while standing. BA staff were very rude in Chicago, did not help us in any way. I was worried about what happens next and how to take care of my 4 months old son and my mother who does not speak English, more over Chicago is not my home town and don't know anyone there. Then I got an idea to meet with Qatar staff because Qatar Airways was my original airline, wanted to give a try, then my fate changed entirely. I encountered with Qatar Airways staff and my experience with them was wonderful and they rebooked our tickets with the Qatar flight which will be starting with in 40 minutes from Chicago without asking for single penny. Qatar Airways staff acted very fast, cleared all formalities within minutes and believe it or not within 30 minutes we were in the flight. I still cannot believe how Qatar Airways staff helped us, the way they treated us, cleared everything in minutes and handled the situation especially when we need a help very badly and with very bad experience earlier with other airlines (AA and BA) even though we approached them in last minute. I am very much thankful to Qatar Airways staff otherwise I would have suffered a lot especially with my 4 months old son and my mother, both completely depends on me.

So at the end as the last people who were served we didn't had a choice of the food. The cabin crew were nice, polite and friendly. They tried their best even if the company didn't provide them enough of tools to make their work excelent. The last issue was getting back my bag. I was in shock when i get my suitcase damaged. I went and reported it right away, I got report and everything was alright. At Tegel Airport I was informed that i have to call company DOLFI that works with Qatar Airways to solve the issue. That's what i did and here i got another suprise! Lady on the phone told me that she can't help me i have to contact airline. I did as she said, customer service informed me that they don't deal with this kind of cases and i have to contact airport crew. Again nice airport manager send me back to DOLFI. And finally everything ends here after 1 month. The issue of suitcase was solved, however it was such a poor service, staff in DOLFI is not informed about their duties, which cause misunderstanding.

" Chicago to Doha. I saw the ticket agent physically deflate when my large piece of luggage came in under the weight requirements. Their luggage handling is infuriating. The 10 across seating in the 777 economy is offering narrow 17"" wide seats. Seat recline is better than most, which can cut both ways - comfortable for sleeping, but if the person in front of you reclines the entire flight, you won't have room to work on your laptop. That doesn't matter much as the 777s don't have wifi. The entertainment choices are excellent, but the screens are old, tired, unintuitive, and not particularly responsive. The flight tracking maps are useless, flashing from a screen showing an ad to a screen showing the pitch of the aircraft, to a sparse map written in only Arabic. To give credit where it's due, they mostly nail the food. Three entree choices, and enough on your tray to constitute a meal. If you're used to US airlines, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount and quality of food provided. Finally, the connections at the Doha airport are a special kind of punishment, it's a massive facility filled with every high end retailer in the world.

" Travelled 21 & 22 Jan 2018 with Qatar Airways from Ho Chi Minh via Doha to Entebbe and Kigali. Reliable airline, punctual flights, world class service, good drinks, poor food with no diversity, small portions, clean, newer aircrafts. Good lounge in Doha with slumber rooms. Luggage transferred with high precision. Terrible bus-gating in Doha: have to walk inside the airport for almost 2 km, for them just to board by taking a bus drive for another 3 km: why don't they then bus people from the central area and drive all 5 km instead of letting everybody walk 2 km first? Elite status respected: staff were very respectful and advising. Very expensive ticket, double price as compared to competing carriers on this route (like ET and KQ). Due to the Arab ban on Qatar, a huge deroute from DOH to East Africa was undertaken to avoid flying over Saudi-Arabia. It consumes 2 hours extra travel. Another 2 hours was added for an un-announced stop in Entebbe. Altogether the flight became a full day flight while it should have been Â½ day flight. Will change carrier next time but accepted this price to retain flyer status at their FFP. Lousy and expensive WiFi offered on-board with lots of patronising registration and information requirements.

" Maputo to Doha. Service is always good with online check-in to beat the queues in many airports. A little more expensive than other airlines in the region, but they fly point to point rather than hubs and transfers, which I prefer. Online services good as is their loyalty programme, although you need to progress to the next tier first before you get anything. Generous baggage and seating space on aircraft is good, although the aisle is narrow and passengers not looking where they are going can easily hit other seated passengers with their bags. Cabin crew are superb and helpful, and if you get them a box of chocolates for the journey they are genuinely pleasantly pleased. The food is normally good as is the choice of beverages on offer. The entertainment system has some good movies, but often has problems working properly. Customer services is absolutely awful, with many queries not answered or the staff point you to the webpage information where you said you didn't understand what was on the page.",Promoter
" I used Qatar Airways for the fourth time late in 2016, on the route Zurich â€“ Bangkok â€“ Zurich, in economy class. On previous flights, I had twice tried to sign on to Qatar's frequent flyer programme, but somehow this did not work out. I had wanted to deposit my need for an aisle seat, as I have a back injury which requires me to get up frequently. On the flight from Doha to Bangkok I was assigned a seat with which there was something wrong. I requested that I be allowed to change the seat, explaining that I might get problems, but was told that this was impossible as the plane was full. In Bangkok, I had to request another passenger to lift my luggage off the belt at the airport. I needed to leave Bangkok eight days earlier than booked. The ticket I had bought stated that I would be charged 173 Swiss francs for any change of reservation, but when I tried to make the change online, the cost was given as 355 Swiss francs. I called the Qatar office in Bangkok. They confirmed that this was a mistake, ""probably a software problemâ€œ, and then proceeded to charge me 202 Swiss francs. I was told that I was charged more because my change of reservation had to made manually. To me, this is not five star.",Passive
 Manchester to Bangkok via Doha. Qatar Airways are absolutely fabulous! I'm so glad that i discovered this airline. Noticeably better than other airlines i have flown with. Booking process is the best it could be. Ground service is very efficient and courteous. Boeing 787 and A380 have comfortable seating (more so on the A380) and the onboard food i always enjoy. Crew are polite and friendly. I hope they remain in a price range that i can afford so that i can continue to fly this airline on my annual two holidays.,Promoter
" Melbourne to Geneva via Doha and Marrakesh to Melbourne on return. Despite good ground service in Geneva and Marrakesh, service was shocking in Qatar. Despite arriving into Qatar from Melbourne with an hour to spare we were not able to board the flight due to their systems. Continued confusion at the airport (after queuing for 20 minutes) meant we were told 3 times we would make the flight, only to be told in the end that we could not. They did re-route us via Geneva and London to Edinburgh, but then there was not enough time for the required connection (this was always going to be impossible). So again we had to re-route, this time via a different London flight and on to Aberdeen instead. Our 22 hour journey ended up being through 5 airports, 42 hours long and we didn't manage to have time for one lounge due to all the continued queuing and waiting. As a shorty (5ft 1) the headrests are badly designed. They push my head forward uncomfortably as they don't go low enough. At least the staff got me extra blankets to sit on, which really did help my neck a lot but was not the comfiest for my bum. There is no foot rest, again a problem for me being short. I tried to use my own Bose headphones with a 2 pin adapter as I do on most flights but with only 4 volume settings and the volume down to its lowest it was unbearably loud. I asked for a headset and got through 4 headsets, not one worked properly. One ear only would work on 3 pairs and with the other it was a robotic sound and I could not hear properly. I ended up using my own headphones but only half on my ears. My handset flashed the entire journey which was very offputting. They tried to re-set it 3 times, but it did not help. For one of the legs I was in an exit row and the handsets are next to your hip which meant I kept pressing the buttons without meaning to, interrupting my movie by randomly selecting a game for example. Food and drink I cannot fault - probably the best airline food I've had in economy. Cabin staff service: was much better than ground staff, very amicable and helpful.",Detractor
" Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo via Doha. Boarding was chaotic staff at DFW were shouting at passengers trying to get them into correct boarding zone. The inbound plane arrived on time but we still left close to hour late. Crew was professional, friendly and proactive. Catering was poor with the exception of soup which was excellent. Food was not heated enough or did not appear fresh. The seat on this Boeing 777 has no privacy. Even with eye mask you can still detect seat mates IFE screen. Pajamas and slippers were nice touch and good quality. Blanket and pillows high quality. Crew kept toilets clean throughout flight. Landed late and parked at remote stand. Transit security was easy at Doha. Lounge is beautiful but signage inside was poor. Odd that the main showers are located behind the dining area. Had to ask staff several times for location.

" My first trip on Qatar Airways flying from Hong Kong to Vienna via Doha, heard a lot of wonderful reviews about them, and my were they true! It has been such a long time since I came across an airlines who did everything right and beyond. QR in my opinion, was excellent, and deserve all the critical acclaims. 4 flights with them, crew and catering on all flights were wonderful. Very consistent good service, my Sapphire status with MH was recognised and acknowledged. Between HK to DOH route, an A350 was deployed, a new beautiful aircraft, very comfortable seat which turn into flat bed. Between DOH to Vienna they use B737, it was just equally as comfortable. Nothing was compromised at all. The transfer in Doha was very smooth and easy, I loved their beautiful and spacious lounge, truly a place to relax. At the end of the last flight, I came to the conclusion that, I have finally found an airlines which really deliver high quality service, and really liked after their premium customers.",Promoter

I don't understand how difficult it is to take care of business class customers. Inflight product is great in the premium class. The lounge Qatar uses in Houston not so great and don't understand while they don't use the BA lounge.",Detractor
" Doha to Athens in January 2017. Smooth transfer through Doha Hamad and on time departure. Only downside was use of transfer bus from gate to aircraft instead of a bridge. Food quality and flight entertainment were excellent, as well as choice of beverages (soft drinks, and juices - not interested in alcoholic drinks as I do not consume them!). During the flight a problem arose with the passenger at the front fully reclining his seat. In spite of my polite requests not to fully recline, he became rude and we started arguing. Cabin staff intervened, first with no success, as the guy became abusive towards me and my wife. The head of cabin crew then intervened successfully. We started talking and explained to me airline procedures relating to this sort of situation. At some stage he held a briefing with cabin crew on all flight events and relevant procedures as well as closing the day. I submitted a written commendation regarding cabin crew professionalism on handling of this sort of situation. Really amicable - well done!",Promoter

TXL-DOH flight excellent, comfortable seats, entertainment system had many choices and worked perfectly, USB charging port, noise-cancelling headphones, provided with complementary pyjamas, amenity kit, 2 types of champagne, delicious meals, excellent service with a smile. Washrooms clean, new and decently-sized. Debarking and layover at DOH no problem, business lounge is easy to find and is 2 floors, buffet restaurant on 2nd floor, spacious, excellent business center, shower facilities, and quiet areas. DOH-ICN leg (8 hours) was even better, there were only 2 people in business class so we were treated like kings. Arrival on time, debarking was painless.

We took off on time, the meal service options were roast chicken with potatoes or beef stew, I chose the chicken which wasn't the best.

We landed at Hammad International airport 30 minutes late, had a 2 hour layover before boarding the Boeing 787-8 to Jakarta, again the legroom was cramped but this time the IFE had a USB charger, so I could charge my phone.

" Doha to Philadelphia. After a 10 hour flight on the Boeing 777-300 I was looking forward to comparing both cabins. I have to say that even tho the A350 is one of my favorite aircrafts because of how much quieter it is and the external camera views that give you a sense of extra safety and peace of mind, I wish the seats were like the ones on the triple seven. The capsule made me feel a bit claustrophobic not to mention that you completely feel far apart from your traveling companion. On the Boeing 777 we were side by side, talking, eating and just loving the flight, on the A350 we felt apart so much so that because the cabin was not full we chose an isle and a window seat (the hallway was between us) but we felt closer. I think Qatar is aware of this and the new Q-Suites will fix this for couples or families that travel together. The tray table is located in a place that during the sleep portion of my 14 hour flight I found myself hitting my knees often. I felt shelled in and at times it was not comfortable. The A350 also has a mini stand in lounge that none used during the flight except for me to actually stretch during portions of the flight. The crew also looked as if they were working with less space than in the triple seven. Qatar's service is the best in the industry so these things I point out just in comparison with the previous equipment flown. I also have to mention that because the same crew had double the passengers to serve they did not spend as much time with you as they did on my previous flight. One thing that is unique to Qatar is their business class affordability if they have the seats to sell the upgrade. On other airlines even if they have the seats they don't give you the opportunity to pay for an upgrade. I booked this 14 hour flight coach and upgraded for $850.00 and trust me the superior service is worth it alone. Qatar has become my airline of choice for international travel.",Promoter
" Manila to Doha. The best traveling experience I've ever had! Qatar airlines is bringing back the glamour and romance of air travel. This flight was 10 hours and we loved every minute of it. You can eat anything from the menu when you want and the crew's attention to detail and genuine friendliness is what makes it all worth it. I prefer the Boeing 777 business cabin over the A350 because you can sit next to your traveling partner, there's less people so the crew really take their time to serve you and attend to your every need plus in my opinion the seat feels a lot more roomier. The check in at the Manila airport was not done by Qatar staff and it was mediocre at best. It felt like I was checked in by robots. This is something that needs to improve. On flights under 10 hours you do not get the pajamas or bed turndown service but despite this I still think Qatar is worthy of their number 1 ranking and is currently the best airline, period.",Promoter

The legroom was very cramped and it was hard for me to fall asleep, dinner service started with delicious Middle eastern fried rice and mango juice was my drink selection.

We boarded the A380 with even friendlier smiles, we took off on time and had a beautiful scenery view of Doha during take off. Breakfast service started and the options were ""French toast covered in vanilla sauce"" or Omelette, I chose the French toast option and it again was delicious, this time I had coke. I started to watch the IFE again, but this time it was faster and had better options. Soon snack service started and the options were Chicken or Vegetarian puffs, I chose the chicken options and it was delicious again, this time I chose the drink of orange juice.

" Flew from Doha to Manila. I would like to begin this review by saying that Qatar offers a superior product and an outstanding service in economy. The B777-300 is a real workhorse however in economy it feels a bit crowded, to be fair the flight was at capacity and having my first flight be on the A350 it was noticeable how much more crowded the 777 felt. The seat has plenty of legroom, the amenities, the food, the entertainment, and the service, are the best that I have experienced in economy on any airline. Overall Qatar has become my favorite airline because of their modern fleet, their amenities in economy, but overall their superior service.",Promoter
" I would like to begin this review by agreeing that Qatar by far is the best airline I have ever flown. The experience on board in economy was the best I have ever had. In this review I have also attached some photos because there is not too much information about economy and you need to know that if you're considering flying this airline please do so because you will not regret it. The seats are comfortable, the food is very good, the entertainment is also very good but the service is outstanding. The seats in coach have plenty of legroom and this aircraft with the interior LED lighting system, the larger than standard windows, and the quiet engines made this 10 hour flight from Philadelphia to Doha very comfortable. The only thing I must point out is that unfortunately the check in at the Philadelphia airport is not done by Qatar personnel instead by a company that does check in for multiple airlines therefore the experience is not so pleasant, in my opinion this is not fair for the airline because it makes the job of the crew on board more difficult. I will do a separate review about the airport in Doha with detailed information. I have to say that the A350 is probably the best aircraft in the market and Qatar by far the best airline in service, comfort, safety, and value for the money paid. My favorite feature of the A350 has to be the external camera views. Qatar is simply changing the way we fly and I'll fly with them as often as I can and you should to.",Promoter

We were on the cancelled flight that another passenger has posted about, and I can confirm that Qatar's handling of the situation was chaotic. Once finally off the plane, despite being almost at the front of the queue, we had to wait two hours before we got sent to a hotel. We were told we would be called or emailed with details of a new flight, but we weren't, and all through the next morning it was impossible to get through to their call centre in Australia, and all of the others seemed to be closed.

" London to Sydney via Doha went without hitch and I was happy with the seat, service, lounge etc and would happily have given a 9/10 rating for this airline. However, on the return from SYD to LHR there was a technical problem with the aircraft and after sitting in our seats for two hours the flight was cancelled due to the 11pm curfew at Sydney airport. Total chaos as we had to re-enter immigration, reclaim baggage and pass through customs eventually ending up in the check in area with only four staff members attempting to deal with all 450+ passengers and no separate queue for business and first class passengers.

" Melbourne to Oslo via Doha, returning from London. I flew on 3 different aircraft with Qatar's business class product and all were consistently amazing. My wife and I flew on the A380 from Melbourne to Doha, the Boeing 787 onto Oslo and A350 out of London before connecting on the A380 back into Melbourne. The 787 was the smallest of Business class but this did not impact the standard or level of service and the seat layout of 1x2x11 is almost identical to the other aircraft. The A350 is about double the size and the A380 would be double that again. 3 out of our 4 flights were overnight and therefor we were able to utilise the lay flat beds, pajamas and noise cancelling headphones to their full advantage. The cabin crew are happy to convert your seat into a bed whilst you get changed in the bathroom. Branded amenity kits are provided. The a la carte menu on all flights was different and you have a wide range of beers and spirits along with a comprehensive international wine and champagne list. First and Business class passengers have the option of boarding first and can enjoy a glass of bubbles .. or two before take off whilst the rest of the plane boards. The A380 also offers the inflight lounge or bar that is for use of First and Business passengers - it allows you a separate space to socialise. There is an impressive cocktail list and a variety of canapes and snacks available too. I can honestly say that I have never experienced such a comfortable flight and the 14 hours to Doha and further 6 hours to Europe went far too quickly. I didn't want to get off the plane. Onboard wifi is available too - 15 mins free or more at a cost if required. The entertainment on board was great and I didn't run out of things to watch or listen too.",Promoter

" Barcelona to Hong Kong return via Doha in business class, and I decided to add my children to the trip (to travel in economy class) about two weeks before the departure. Qatar Airways website would not sell me a ticket for them, so I called their call centre and they were happy to sell me two return economy tickets for my 4 and 7 year old. On arrival at check in at Barcelona the staff realised that the tickets I had been sold for the children were illegal because the younger of the two children was under 5, which they told me is the minimum age on that airline for travel in a cabin separate from the parents. As the flight was leaving in two hours I was offered two alternatives: to downgrade myself to economy with the children with no compensation, or pay the airport upgrade price for them to travel with me in business, which I did because the staff at BCN believed Qatar would refund me as the mistake was theirs. On the return trip from HKG the check in staff had no problem with the children travelling in economy and me in business and the return trip was far easier. I was astounded by the mistakes and three months later, Qatar is still refusing me any refund or any form of compensation for the money I was forced, apparently needlessly, to spend on the outward journey so that the children could travel with me in business class.

" Atlanta to Chennai return via Doha. Baggage check-in process was simple and easy. Meal preferences was good - I'm a vegetarian and on the onward journey forgot to specify the meal preference but the crew had enough inventory to meat the requirements. Every seat was provided with a small plastic pouch/packet/goodie bag that consisted of a eye mask, pair of sock, toothpaste+brush, hand cream. This was very useful and effective. Entertainment options were good and current. Online check-in wasn't easy",Passive
" Doha to Budapest. I would like thank the Cabin Manager on my flight (QR199, 17 November) for her and the crew's exceptional service and caring kindness. Due to my diet regulations I wasn't supposed to consume most of the served food on the aircraft but I was offered some extra healthy snack without even asking for it. They were awesome, thank you.",Promoter
" On the 14/15th November I travelled with Qatar Airways from Cape Town to London Heathrow, I was impressed with the service given on both flights. Both aircraft's were very clean including the toilets which quite often smell on some operator's. The service was very good for economy and cabin crew were great, they were all helpful and spent time to answer any questions in a friendly manor. I will definitely travel with Qatar again.",Promoter
" We were flying from Paris to Doha in business class in the new Q-suite. You are immediately overwhelmed by the luxury this new suite has to offer. We fly as a couple and when we were seated they lowered the blind in between the two seats so you immediately felt that you had your own private compartment. We were receiving a refreshment drink to our choice before take off. After take-off you can close the doors on your suite and then it really feels like you are in a private room on an airplane. The seats have many modification possibilities, even a real double bed feature. My wife fell in love with the blankets who were especially designed for this new q-suite, they feel so nice. The in-flight entertainment set provides a very big bright screen and the latest hollywood blockbusters available. The cabin crew was so nice to us, they really made this trip even more special by the way they treated us. I had pre-ordered an asian vegetarian meal but the flight attendant looked through the menu with me to see if i changed my menu to what i preferred most. It was no problem to switch the desert and main course since it looked more appetising to me. The food was really good. Even with ordering some snacks they explained everything what was on the menu and recommended the size of portions i ordered. It was really an amazing experience and we never thought we were kinda disappointed that the 6:30hr flight was over.",Promoter
" Bangkok to London via Doha. Check in at BKK was quick and easy offered fast track immigration and lounge access with my FF status QR use the Thai Airways lounge in satellite E which was packed so I didn't stay long. Boarding from E1 was organised and very early completed 30 min before departure time I was a bit sceptical using the 777-300ER because of the 3-4-3 seating my previous QR 777 flight was only 25% full so comfortable but again this flight was only 50% capacity so had 3 seats to myself 12A. Aircraft was clean and tidy and departed before scheduled departure time. Once airborne a pretty decent breakfast served along with drinks and a hot sandwich 1hr 30 min out of DOH. This 7hr flight was great I managed to sleep 4 hrs. I only had 45min to transfer at DOH although it was plenty of time with the flight to LHR departing from the next gate. My first time on an A350 and what a nice aircraft, lucky enough another half empty aircraft in economy so once again I had an exit row to myself 30K. Departed on time and again food served within an hour of departure, the flight went quickly, great service, food was good for economy. The aircraft is great, very comfortable. Arrived on time with bags waiting once through immigration. the best 2 economy flights I have had for many years. Clean aircraft, great crew, good food and great value for this trip. Still my favourite long haul airline.",Promoter
"â   Durban to Stockholm via Doha. First flight Durban to Doha left on time. Crew were good, had a one hour stop in Johannesburg for refueling and picking up passengers. IFE is very good. Main meal was good although the portions these days are extremely small. All drinks including water are served in small plastic cups. Plenty of drink runs were made throughout the flight. Only disappointment was the breakfast, some sort of snack wrap which was awful. Stockholm to Durban was delayed once we were all on board and ready to take-off. Not the airlines fault, there was a medical problem with one of the passengers so we parked and medics were called. It meant we missed our connection in Doha, As we came off the plane there was our name on a board, the ground crew had our new boarding passes and vouchers for a hotel, very officiant! Beautiful 5 star hotel (even for economy class passengers) far better than the one Emirates uses in Dubai. Very generous meal allowance of $180 per person, couldn't even spend it all. I have flown with all three Gulf airlines and have to say Qatar Airways is by a long mile the best. PS - $380 return Durban / Stockholm on a 24 hour special, unbelievable.",Promoter
" Delhi to London via Doha. The return flight from DEL to DOH was uneventful, mainly due to the fact I slept most of the way. With a 3.45 departure I could not believe ear plugs had been removed from the wash bag to be replaced by a lip balm. In DOH I was told that even with a First ticket you could not take a guest with you, even though he was on a business ticket. A380 back to LHR, the difference between Qatar's business and first is the seat. The cabin was spacious and the seat did make a comfortable bed, but no pjamas offered and no mattress cover, only a meager thin blanket con this daytime flight. Food was the same as business , nothing special. Free wifi provided was very patchy. Took a trip to the bar to see it as had been told was worth a look, and it was but very busy, so retreated back to my seat. Crew on this flight were a delight, CSD was professional but friendly and the other crew were a joy! Much better standard than on the way out. Personally I don't think first class is worth the price with Qatar difference with in business.",Passive

Seats configuration of economy class on Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner not the best but at least it's not cramped like on big airlines of Europe or Asia. At the end of the day you get what you paid for, so if you want better food options, a seat like a sofa at your home or you need someone to put pillow under your head - choose business or first class accordingly. I'm 100% happy with what they offered and what I had because many similar airlines doesn't have even half of what Qatar Airways has.",Promoter

The flight was good although food not especially from Doha to Amsterdam which was terrible (a smaller plane), then on the flight back to Australia on A380 the food was bad as well - the breakfast I chose was cream scrambled eggs - the first time food was cold so the air hostess brought another plate which was uncooked and not eaten, and coffee came out black and cold - orange juice warm and no ice. The staff were lovely but either did not have the training or did not understand to know what I was complaining about.",Passive
"  Copenhagen to Male via Doha. The business class seat in the middle is very exposed on the 787, however the A350 was a much nicer cabin experience, even though the central overhead lockers are removed, the A350 seemed my more spacious and airy. Food was nothing exceptional, dine on demand is fine in business, however if your to sleep and the passenger opposite decides at 2am to eat, you'll be disturbed. The pyjamas were a lovely touch, but the rest of the bedding was really poor, think blankets and lumpy pillows. Service out of CPH was rushed and the crew seemed harangued, however on the MLE sector it was much improved, the cabin was half full. I think Qatar crews lack the finesse and professionalism of Singapore Airlines, quite disappointed for my first time with QR.",Passive
"  Qatar Airways is one of the best airlines I have ever flown with. The service onboard is fabulous. However on this flight to Paris - Bangkok - Doha and then Doha - Paris, I noticed a few things which should be improved. Check-in in Bangkok could be better and more classy. Business check-in was a bit too laid back. In Bangkok, Qatar uses Thai Airways Business lounge. It is a great lounge but some privileges are not accessible to Qatar business class passengers, massages for instance. Onboard, it was great however the selection of wines was better a few years ago. For instance, Pol Roger rosÃ© was a better Champagne than Lanson.",Promoter

Its the attitude of the crew that make a real difference. Overall a very pleasant experience.,Promoter
"  Bangkok to Atlanta via Doha. I had 6 meals on this trip, sampled the first, picked at the second and third and just looked at the rest to see if there were any positive changes. Only one time did the attendant came by to pick up used cups, napkins. Since I had a window seat, I did not feel like squeezing past the aisle seat and walking my garbage down to the galley. They were good about handing out water - just not about collecting it. A340 had the shortest legroom I have experienced, my seat back was short and uncomfortable and the bathroom nearest me ran out of water early into the flight. I needed Wi-Fi from DOH to ATL but they did not offer any.",Detractor
"  Manchester to Auckland via Doha legs seemed to be older planes, with seats in pairs rather than singles on an angle. Food was okay. I was looking forward to a cold beer but only 2 options of lager which is my last resort. The staff were all very attentive. Return flight Auckland to Doha had same pod set up which was again disappointing. The Doha to MAN leg actually had a newer plane, quieter and with individual pods - significantly better all round. I'm quite tech savvy but their in flight viewing control system remained a mystery to me, I managed to watch stuff but it wasn't particularly intuitive. On the last leg on the newer plane I had the problem of not being able to turn the headphone volume down enough, changing headphone set made no difference. Ended up having to have the headphone half open on my ears to reduce the volume. No one else seemed to have an issue.",Promoter

"  London to Tokyo via Doha. Checked in on line and choose seat a for both myself and my partner, bag drop at LHR T4 quick and polite security was very quick at 11am on a Thursday morning, was given access to the Skyteam lounge with my oneworld status? Qatar never offer there own lounge to FF but I guess it is advised in the rules. Anyway Skyteam lounge is pretty comfortable so fine. Boarded through gate A6 it was all very quick on to a newish clean A380 seats 31A & 31B on the upper deck.. Departed on time the flight wasn't full so a pretty nice atmosphere on board. Lunch served shortly after airborne was actually very nice lots of drinks offered during the flight with a hot sandwich tra coffee served about an hour before arrival. Had 3 hours in Doha which was a pleasant time visiting the shops onyx lounge and a walk around. Boarding the DOH-NRT flight from D22 via a bus however it wasn't too bad. The aircraft was spotless and strangely almost empty so while we had assigned seats we actually sat where we wanted with all but about 20 seats in the last cabin almost free. Departed on time again once airborne breakfast served quickly. I then slept across 4 seats for 6 hours once awake was offered coffee before I guess pre landing dinner which was okay but not as good as the previous flight. Landed on time after 9hrs 30min the whole trip was longer but much better than my usual BA. I have used QR about 20 times now in both business & economy. Economy upper deck on the A380 is difficult to beat. My first time on the 777-300ER with 3-4-3 seating and pleased it was pretty empty because I can imagine it would be pretty cramped when full.",Promoter

The terminal they use at Manchester Airport couldn't be further from the train station, and Economy check-in was pretty average. Flight and food were fine. Staff quite attentive. Doha Airport looked fantastic but organisationally it was a bit haphazard.

On this trip I enjoyed the older 777 layout and entertainment system over the so called state of the art 787-8 which had hard seats that hurt my shoulder with very little privacy. The entertainment system on the outbound flight was ok but on the 787 was very difficult to operate. Food on both flights was less than average, the encrusted chicken tasted awful and even worse was my choice of appetizer on the return flight, the Arabic Mezze which I missed was dropped by the cabin attendant and it was the last one. I had to miss that and even the ice cream was out, I just did not know what I had paid for.",Passive
"  Baku to Muscat via Doha. My flight Baku to Doha at 3:30AM has been cancelled because of technical issues and I was late for my next flight from Doha to Muscat.

Their staff informed me about that just 3.5 hours before original flight departure and that they are can't book me on other airlines flight. Even after I spoke with Duty Officer and explained I need to be at work tomorrow, they didn't help. My original tickets were for Business Class from Baku and First Class from Doha, but when I came to Airport for a flight booked for me, staff issued me Economy Class ticket for my flight from Doha. When I asked why, they said the QA system now shows Economy Class. It took me some time to prove that my original cancelled flight was for First class.

The entertainment system proved slow/inconvenient and is not comparable to Qatar's own aircraft. The service was very slow and partially disorganized. This resulted e.g. in no drinks being served together with the meal. They have cut down on the menu choices compared to previous flights. Both the starter as well as the main course were tasteless.

"  Flew Chennai to New York JFK via Doha. Business class is really great especially on the Doha to New York Sector. Almost every few seats have a dedicated stewardess who pampers you all throughout the 12-13 hours. My biggest disappointment was they overbooked the flight from Doha to Chennai and upgraded several Economy passengers to Business. I have no worries with that and have been lucky myself several times. However, Qatar has to be sensitive to Business travellers who prefer to travel alongside other serious business travellers and not passengers who are noisy and get tipsy halfway through the flight. Will stop flying Business on Qatar if they don't profile passengers before upgrading them to higher class of travel.",Detractor
"  Johannesburg to Chicago via Doha. Qatar Airways went beyond expectations when dealing with my luggage enroute to South Africa from Toronto with a transfer in Philly.

On my return overnight flight back from JoBurg, I accidentally left a package in the overhead bin. The manager at the transfer desk personally arranged for that package to be brought immediately from the plane, which was parked far away from the actual terminal building, to me so I could take it on my connecting flight to Chicago.

"  Check-in at Manchester was excellent, although I'd pre-selected my seat I was offered and accepted a change to a seat in the first row with additional legroom. Qatar use the Escape lounges at Manchester which now has a separate business lounge with hot meal options. The flight was 40 minutes late departing from Manchester and as I only had one hour transit in Doha I was concerned about getting my connection, the cabin crew were very supportive and kept checking the likely arrival time and explained if I missed my flight there was another Bangkok flight not long afterwards, they found out the gate number of my flight and made sure I was the first person off the aircraft. Flight was excellent, seats comfortable even for passengers of my height I've always considered the food on Qatar to be the best with lots of choice a decent choice of entertainment on the video channels. I did make my connection but it was a bit tight. Outgoing flights were on A330 / A340 while returning aircraft's were Boeing 777 / 787. In my opinion little to choose between them although the 787 has the best seating 1x2x1, all aircraft's had been changed since I first booked, not a huge problem apart from having to forever change your preferred seat on the Qatar website. Being able to pre-order your main meal in advance was new although it's only on flights from Doha at present. Outstanding flight crews on all four flights, friendly and attentive to your needs a credit to Qatar Airways. Due to short transit time didn't have time to visit the business class lounge at Hamad International Airport although I did manage a short time there on my flight home. Similar experience at Bangkok, early check-in for flights and fast track through passport control the new Qatar lounge isn't open yet so still using one or other of two Thai Airways lounge noticed they've removed the TV screen since me previous visit which only ever had CNN.

There was no WiFi and the entertainment system is not as good as on Qatar Airways own aircrafts. The seats were good and you had enough legroom including a footrest.

I had to stay an extra night in Male due to this delay it made sense to me that Qatar Airways will pay the additional cost. So I submitted the hotel receipt to Qatar Airways but the customer service agent replied that they will not reimburse the additional cost incurred due to this delay.

"  Sofia to Hong Kong via Doha. I had the worst experience with staff at Doha Airport. I chose a flight with a longer transit in between, so I could see Doha with a complimentary tour of Doha. I landed just in time to make it to their evening tour, which is the last tour of the day. I had about 45 min before the tour starts, so as soon as I landed, I quickly made my way to the immigration, and headed out. When I was out, I was looking for the location of the desk, where it says it's at concourse B. I managed to find WH Smith, but there was no desk close by. I went to the information desk and asked where to find this tour, the lady told me it's before immigration. I know I was running out of time, it wouldn't make sense for me to go back to the other side and come back out again. Therefore I asked the lady if she could call the tour desk for me, to let them know I was waiting outside. The lady was not helpful at all, she was unwilling to call for me. I asked her what option do I have if I want to join the tour, she said I have to go back in to join the tour. So I followed her advice and went back in. Before I went back in, I spoke to 2 other staff, I told them the reason I was out, and the reason I had to go back inside, they just said â€˜ok' and pointed towards the security and immigration to me. I wanted to make sure I can actually go back inside and come back out again afterwards. Since 2 people I've asked said ok, I thought it would be ok. By the time I got back in, I finally found his desk for the tour. There was a closed sign at the desk, but I went to speak to the lady there, she told me I was too late, they cannot add me to the tour group any more. She told me to come back the next day. My connecting flight was early morning, I would be gone by then! I saw an information desk about Doha, so I went over, and asked for some information if I wanted to go out myself (the only helpful and friendly guy I've spoken to during my time at the Doha Airport!) I've got all the information I need, including a map, so I was ready to go through immigration to head out again on my own this time. However, immigration did not let me through, they said I already used my one time visa, so I can't go out again.",Detractor

Qatar Airways London lounge is first rate, seriously good food, table clothes, table service, friendly professional staff and they even have magazines you want to read. When you get on the flight to Doha, the cabin is awesome - Q class, means you essentially have small area to yourself. Food on the plane on a par with Emirates, and the whole flight and approach of the staff really good. I am shortly flying business on BA to Toronto, I will report back on it, but am not optimistic.

"  Manchester to Doha and return. Originally booked this flight for the Boeing 787 operating it but about 4 weeks before departure noticed that it was now an A330, no problem as I like the A330. Check in at Manchester was very good, the ladies on Business class were fast and very funny and it was an enjoyable experience. The business class lounge was a disappointment. The plane had the new style seats fitted - in my opinion these are not as good as the old seats. Sitting in the window seat with the passenger in the aisle seat fully reclined, it needs mountaineering skills to get to the aisle. Also, the window seat has very restricted room for your feet when fully reclined. The IFE was OK but I struggled to find anything that I really wanted to watch. By far the worst aspect (and this applies to Emirates A380 too) was the almost total lack of room for your elbows, you are very restricted. The cabin service on the outbound flight was superb, the food was good and the provision of non alcoholic Champagne is very welcome to any teetotallers travelling. On the return journey the check in was superb and very efficient. The business class lounge was crowded and there was a queue for the toilets but they were kept clean. The plane was again fitted with the new seating arrangements and again I prefer the old style but the general cabin appearance gives a feeling of space. Cabin service again was very good and you got the feeling that nothing was too much trouble. Food was OK and was well presented. On both flights, the toilets were kept very clean and stocked with toothbrushes and toiletries. All in all a totally different experience from the last time I travelled with Qatar, the cabin crew were exceptionally good.",Promoter
"  Doha to Bali and return. Outward journey was very good, as soon as we were seated FA came round with pyjamas, a nice touch but unfortunately too small for me. Cabin service was excellent with the dine on demand feature welcome, we had eaten in Doha airport so weren't too hungry on the way out. Seats were comfortable with room to get round the fully reclined seat of neighbouring passenger. Plenty of leg and arm room and the food and drink on offer was good. Managed to sleep for part of the journey and enjoyed the flight. The return journey was also very good with excellent service from the cabin services director. Due to feeling unwell I did not take any food but was kept well supplied with water by the cabin crew. On both flights the toilets were kept very clean and well stocked. Both flights departed on time, although when leaving Bali we were delayed at the runway access for 20 minutes waiting for an incoming flight. On this experience I would recommend Qatar Airways.",Promoter
"  Stockholm to Singapore via Doha. Checking at Stockholm at a deserted and eerily quiet Terminal 5 at Stockholm Airport. A fragile sticker for my suitcase could not be supplied by the not so friendly check in agent. Lounge at Stockholm very basic with poor choice of Food and Drinks. Flight was good as always on Qatar Airways. Great personalized service, decent food, great seat and good IFE. Transfer at Doha airport was chaos at security check. Speak lane for priority pax could not be found. Qatars lounge is soulless. it was so crowded at 7 am, the waiting time for a shower was about an hour, and lines at the toilets about 15 minutes. I left after a few minutes since waiting at the gate was more relaxing. Flight to Singapore was great on a spanking new A350, lot more quiet and less dry than the Boeing 787 on the previous flight. Service was as always topnotch. Qatar is great in the air, but Doha airport is lacking basic facilities at its business class lounge, and has unorganized security checks for transit pax. I",Passive
"  Copenhagen to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha. Flights faultless and on time. Check-in efficient. Travelled 1-way economy, previously denied upgrade to business as â€œno seatsâ€ available. However, they try to sell the business seats or upgrade for cash until last day. Eventually, at check-in, I upgraded to business class for miles (â€œQ-creditsâ€). This was easy, and I had only to wait 5 Minutes until the flight manager could confirm that the appropriate food could be availed within this short notice of only 2Â½ hours. It worked out and I signed a form to deduct Q-credits from my FFP programme. In Copenhagen QR uses Aspire, a third party lounge, one of the poorest lounges â€“ no hot food, poor drinks etc. Boarding was easy and quick. At seat, pre-departure soft drinks were drink provided. No pre-departure champagne offered â€“ only for CPH and CDG in Europe champagne is not served pre-departure? Food was so, so and tasteless. Drinks and wine list were excellent, served upon take off with hot nuts and hot towels. New onboard is an Italian beer Peroni, which is quite good and tasty. Guinness, Stella Artois, and Corona have gone. The safety video has improved. The annoying charity collections on Educate a Child goes on, I am puzzled by this. Flight 75% full, in business 7 passengers. Good 4-star Hotel provided free of charge in Doha while waiting in transit (20 hours). This is not available for the very cheapest fares. Al Mourjan lounge in Doha always deliver. I sat in the champagne bar and ordered fish sandwich from the remote sandwich-cafÃ©. They brought it within 5 Minutes despite the distance is 400 meters. Well done. The bartenders did not have their best day, but the visitors made up for it. I don't like that some visitors paid tips to lounge staff. DOH-SGN: again upgraded using Q-credits two hours before departure: I did so as I realised that any seatblock would be impossible with only 10 vacant seats left in economy. Flight 95% full. Good FA team onboard, I was treated like a king, got double of everything (2 seats, 2 amenity kits, 2 pyjamas). Crew were very joyful, joking, focused, and in good shape â€“ worked hard throughout the flight. Luggage delivered on the belt in Saigon within a few Minutes.

When I reached to Airport and I had asked from the Airport Customer Service Staff for baggage drop facilities to drop my bag. Finally I reached to check-in counter and staff checked-in my baggage. I had asked him about the gate number and he replied to me gate is not allocated yet. I went to food court for coffee and I did not receive any notification from check-in staff, suddenly I saw the gate number on information screen and gate number was final call. I did not miss my flight. I rushed to the gate and I went to aircraft along with other passengers by bus instead of aero bridge.

Returned 9 hours later at 3:30am. Had to spend $480 on taxi fares. Arrived in Doha, delay meant we missed our connecting flight so we had to spend a day in Qatar. Waited in line for another hour while accommodation was arranged. They put us in the Best Western which was a nightmarish slum. Told not to leave the hotel.

"  New York JFK to Doha. They still have a 2-2-2 seating configuration in this Boeing 777 business class cabin with no partitions for privacy. With all seats in the cabin taken, it felt hot and claustrophobic. Flight attendants were responsive and polite. An impressive large selection of movies available and I was able to catch up on some old Hitchcock classics. The food was unmemorable and the lamb dish was salty, the meat chewy. With meals available any time, flight attendants scurried around during much of the flight laying table cloth and cutlery, serving multi course meals and then clearing the table. Comfortable 180 degree seats with massage features. Nice hard shell amenities kit. Ample overhead stow space though hardly any space around your seat to keep your documents, personal electronic device, reading material or eye glasses. Flight was on schedule and that enabled me to make a stress free onward connection.",Passive
"  Auckland to Athens via Doha. You get what you pay for in economy class, a cheap ticket, mediocre experience. The cabin and ground staff were very nice and helpful. There were several meal options per flight (move snacks, main meal, ice cream snack etc). The toilets and cabin were kept clean and lots of trays of water were served. The leg room was very problematic for me. On the leg from Auckland to Doha the air conditioning was not functioning properly for several hours making it uncomfortably warm during a very long bout of turbulence. From Athens to Doha the meal service was excruciatingly slow and the main meal was inedible. Our row were given the last of three meal choices (Chicken) as they had run out of everything else. The two people next to me complained and they somehow found a pasta and beef meal for them. All of us could not eat more than one fork full of our meals as they were completely dry and overcooked, and tasteless. The media service on the shorter legs was non existent. On the Doha to Auckland routes was okay as long as you don't mind having to see the same adverts in front of every media offering - aimed at residents of Doha. Movies were oddly curated. The staff are lovely but is economy class a 5 star experience, no.",Passive
"  Another wonderful experience with Qatar Airways, upgraded to First Class from Melbourne to Doha on the A380. Very attentive flight attendants, with delicious food and wine served. The bathroom is a whole other level of luxury with plenty of space and hidden drawers for the amenities. The cabin itself is small and very private, and extremely comfortable. Business class Doha to Helsinki on the smaller A321, once again very attentive service by the flight attendants on this sector and Athens to Doha and Doha to Melbourne. Seats ok on the A321, could be improved. Flew business class on the A330 from Athens which was comfortable, and the marvellous A380 Doha to Melbourne. Loved the Business class service on this flight, it was faultless, the flight attendant looking after our section was superb and was very attentive. Will definitely fly Qatar Airways again.",Promoter
"  Flew Doha to Kolkata. A superb inflight experience. Smooth night flight that was on schedule. Inflight staff exceedingly attentive. Excellent selection of movies from all over the world. Food and wine offerings were varied and ample. A full course dinner was served at a time of my choosing. The seat layout, 1-2-1, provided not only space but privacy too. The seat had several configuration angles and were easy to use to get into a comfortable sitting position or sleep which I was able to for a couple of hours. A nice amenities bag was provided. A small disappointment was that none of the four items I selected from the in-flight duty free catalog was available. I would also have liked the Indian government landing card provided on board as it would avoid some hassle before the immigration counter on arrival. On this route, I would unhesitatingly fly Qatar Airways again.

  Kuala Lumpur to London via Doha. Three of us were travelling under two bookings and the online facility was not allowing me to sit with two of my family. Luckily at check-in this was rectified so we were provided with 2 blocks of 3 seats for both legs. The flight was amended out of KUL so we missed the A350 and were changed to QR15 which was 2 hours later into LHR. Both planes left on time. Toilets were clean although water was not draining from the sink hole. Food was good - I had potatoes gratin with random white fish served with the usual roll and some trimmings. The sandwich on serving 2 is not a sandwich but a dough slice. Wine volume has been reduced ( I fly Qatar 2/3 times per year ) and I was given 85 ml on my first serving and 100ml on my second serving. Qatar normally provides 187mm bottles and on a 7 hour leg you always get 3 if you ask. IFE screen was only partially responsive,Passive

All throughout the flight I was worried that if my luggage didn't come with me what I would wear. The flight was very smooth. The cabin service was great. Food was excellent. Flight was on time. On the down side, the wifi hardly worked. The seats were uncomfortable. I say small because with the hype of travelling in luxury on 380 I expected more.

"  Johannesburg to Montreal via Doha with Qatar Airways. Arrived at the check-in counter only to find it not open despite it being 3 hours before the departure time. Following check-in which offered no hint of a problem, I proceeded to the lounge first and then the gate close to the scheduled departure time. At 30 minutes to departure there was no aircraft and no sign of ground agents which was the first sign of a pending problem. After the agents showed up and at around the scheduled departure time, the electronic boards showed a gate change but the gate agents could not confirm it. Eventually, all passengers made their way to the new gate where we were told the plane had a technical issue but it was almost resolved meaning we would board shortly. As minutes ticked away, this story changed multiple times and finally at midnight the station manager showed up to tell all of us that the flight was cancelled. What unfolded after can only be described as pandemonium with 200+ passengers many of which had already missed their connecting flights from Doha demanding answers from the ground agents who seemed to be unable to provide straight answers. All passengers were bussed to nearby hotels and many of us are getting to our destination 24 hours later than planned.

I've always travelled to Singapore with Singapore Airlines, economy usually, but the jump to business was steep, almost Â£1,000 more than Qatar at the time I booked - now I'm hooked on Qatar's hospitality. The seat was so comfortable, whichever setting I had it on, I wanted the flight to continue even after landing. The food was delicious, and presented beautifully.

"  Dallas Fort Worth to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. Such a pleasant flight with Qatar Airways. I have sat in multiple business class flights but this was one of my most pleasant long-haul flights. I believe my satisfaction has to do with the superior flight attendants for both the flights. Not only were they attentive, they were fast in their service and always with a smile. What's more, they were even considerate enough to ask when we would like our meals to be served. I would like to particularly thank one cabin staff who served me on flight from Doha to Kuala Lumpur with her gentle voice and pleasant smile. She made me feel right at home upon stepping into the aircraft with her exceptional service. I would also like to note that the take-off and landing both times were flawless. Thumbs up to the captain. The Godiva chocolate is a nice touch. Without a doubt, I would choose to fly with Qatar again. Can't wait to experience their QSuites.

"  Edinburgh to Muscat via Doha. I used to fly British Airways 3 or 4 times a year between Muscat and Edinburgh but considering the visible decline in both aircraft quality and service now being offered by BA I decided to try Qatar Airways. The difference is night & day! From booking to boarding there is nothing that is too much trouble for Qatar Airways staff. Onboard you will find spotless aircraft, in my case the fabulous A350 between Muscat and Doha and the equally pleasant 787-8 Doha to Edinburgh. You will also experience a crew that are not only efficient but also value you as a passenger. Although I was travelling in Business class both the Muscat - Doha and Doha - Muscat sectors are ticketed in First which allowed me access to the First Class lounge at Doha airport. This far exceeds the lounges offered by BA in both Edinburgh and T5 Heathrow. Both aircraft provided comfortable seating and decent IFE in the ""Oryx One"" system. Food and beverage service is excellent with Qatar offering an ""eat on request"" service which eliminates the requirement of a food cart. Meals are served individually on white linen with proper cutlery and tableware. There was an excellent choice of refreshments to accompany meals and additional snacks and refreshments can be requested throughout the flight. I recognize that Qatar Airways are not the cheapest option but in a ""value for money"" comparison with other available carriers I feel they are a very good choice. I will be booking this years Christmas escape with Qatar Airways. Truly a 5 star airline.",Promoter

"  Bangkok to Milan via Doha, returning from Rome. Check in was a breeze, and I waited only 5 minutes. I was greeted by the cabin senior, who was polite and welcoming. This flight was about 85% full. I was seated where the second cabin senior with 12 years' experience was in charge of, he was polite and observant. He noticed my mother sitting in the middle seat squeezed in and very uncomfortable, and he said he will move her to a more comfortable spot once the service ends. Food on board this flight was sub par. The 777's seats are tight, and overhead bins get filled up very quickly. Transfer in Doha was really tight, with no time to spare. The next flight to Milan was an A330. I prefer 2-4-2 configuration more than 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 configuration, as couples can sit together. On this flight, the crew were much more experienced, friendly and professional. On the return flight, check in at Rome was worse than Bangkok. Boeing 787 roomy atmosphere on board all added to a great flight. The seats are very comfortable and felt like an armchair in full recline. The crew on this flight were fantastic. After breakfast service, I went to talk to the cabin senior in the galley, and he had some spare business class meals, and he obliged me to try them, and he also gave me some snacks, which was everything an avgeek could ask for. Before landing, he asked me if wanted to try the business class seats. On the flight to Bangkok, it was another 777, and the crew were still excellent.

  Denpasar to Berlin via Doha in July 2017. This time I was lucky to get both legs on the A330-300 so I could avoid the Boeing 777-300 and cramped B787. The A330-300 operates with the rather spacious 2-4-2 seat configuration whereas the B773 is 3-4-3 and the B787 is 3-3-3. As a result you get a much better passenger staff ratio and better service in the A330 compared to the Boeing aircraft. Moreover you get more personal space (33 inch seat pitch and 17.5 inch seat width). On the Boeing 777-300 with 3-4-3 configuration you have to queue at the lavatories struggling to get through the narrow aisles. My suggestion would be to choose the aircraft wisely if you have the option to do that.,Passive

Check-in operated by SAS staff at Stockholm opens 3hrs before, a little slow as they validate visas and pass people along to pay extra baggage where applicable, but nothing worryingly so - all outsourced check-in is the same in my experience. Boarding Boeing 787 was efficient. Aircraft hot until about 15 minutes after departure. Legroom and space felt very limited, especially with the IFE box under the non-middle seats, but it wasn't the nightmare I had geared myself up to expect. It took a while for water to be distributed, a small bottle of water on each seat would go far to passive passenger until the first service. Water only available in tiny glasses, no larger containers or bottles available. Transfer at Doha efficient, the benefits of bus service is they open both front and rear doors, so the five minutes you spend on the airport tour is mitigated by the ten minutes saved by non-bridge disembarking. Flight to Bangkok on Boeing 777 full, gate security slow, seats a little better than 787 due to no IFE box. Plane hot, several minute pushback delay and no water again for the first hour.

On the last big sector the handset was broken and the touch screen had an intermittent fault and USB port was no-go so I could not charge my phone. Cabin crew dismissed the issue with the AV system. No major cabin issues.",Passive
"  Adelaide to Zurich via Doha on the new A350 with airy cabin lay out in Business. The seats are comfortable, the bed is big in size but not comfortable as some competitors. The food was rather limited and the same as on the flights from Europe earlier: a disappointing experience. The Entertainment system had the same quality and quantity problem and deficiencies as on my flights to Australia one week earlier: limited western movies and classical music on offer and bad quality of head sets. Cabin crew was young and friendly, but inefficient. I enjoyed rather quite flights with no major turbulences but disappointment with food, entertainment and cabin crew.",Detractor
"  Manila to Paris via Doha. Qatar Airways is in a class of its own! Everything is superb, from check in to the flights themselves. Oryx One is one of the top IFE systems I've experience, with nice movie and tv program selections. Manila to Doha flight, the plane used was Boeing 777-300ER. The flight was full and a red eye flight. Cabin Crew were very accommodating and friendly. The cabin crew won't disturb passengers who are sleeping. Food was served twice in the flight, one around 30 mins after take off and one 2 hours before landing. Food taste is ok, not that great but ok for airline food. For the Doha to Paris flight, the plane used was the A380 which is my favorite plane due to the comfort it gives to the passenger aside from being very quiet. This is where one flight attendant was a bit of a let down because she wasn't that accommodating and she speaks like she is a bit grumpy. Also, the food that I want (chicken) was short on stock so I chose fish which turned out ok. Overall, I still recommend Qatar Airways if you're coming from Southeast Asia or even East Asia going to Europe. It really deserves its 2017 Airline of the Year award!",Promoter
"  Venice to Male via Doha. I chose Qatar Airways because of the lower pricing and good time schedule. The flight experience has been quite amazing even in economy class. The food was good, and beverage was served constantly during the flight to keep us hydratated. Crew on Qatar Airways is the best you can find, they are very polite and kind, treating you like a king in particular if you are a member of their frequent flyer program like I am. The aircraft on all four flight was an A330-200/300, and comfortable. On the first flight the A332 (A7-ACF/12 years old) was refurbished and it seemed quite new, Ife (Oryx ONE) on this flight was displayed on large HD touch screens. On the other flights the aircraft wasn't refurbished so the IFE was old and controllable only with the remote control (there was also a big ife box under windows seats obstructing more than a quarter of foot room) - the seats weren't as comfortable as the ones on the first aircraft. Aircraft age was the main negative aspect of this trip, but on all four aircraft there was a wide selection of music, tv, film, games. All four flights were on time and ground service in Doha was good.",Promoter
  Hanoi to Bangkok. Check in was simple and straight forward. The seat was comfortable and a light meal was served (this was a short flight). The cabin crew were efficient and friendly. The flight left and landed on time. Baggage was waiting by the time I got through Immigration. The flight was uneventful and the reviews matched my experience. I would fly Qatar Airways again.,Promoter
"  Perth to Milan via Doha using Qatar Airways. Check-in at Perth Airport was easy and seamless. I checked in online so I needed to do was to drop off my luggage at the airport. I have not flown Qatar Airways for more than a decade and I am really impressed with the improvements. Plenty of leg room and the seats are comfortable for both Perth to Doha (using B777-200) and Doha to Milan (A330-200). On both sectors, I was well taken care off. The cabin crew were really friendly and helpful. I am impressed even on economy class we were offered three different options for mains and there is always a vegetarian option which is really considerate of Qatar Airways. There are plenty of inflight entertainment to keep me occupied for the long hours flight and the inflight magazine, Oryx has plenty of interesting content to keep me entertained as well. Overall a good experience and I will recommend Qatar Airways to others.",Promoter
"  I was seated in lower deck A380 economy cabin and I found the seat cramped and uncomfortable (32"" seat pitch). I couldn't eat the sandwich that was some sort of vegetable sausage roll and the vegetarian breakfast was unappetising.

"  Sydney to Athens via Doha. We had an excellent trip on Qatar Airways overall. The tickets were among the cheapest available when we booked and the flight times were the quickest. The connection times through Doha were very quick. The airport in Doha was modern and easy to navigate. The plane seemed newer than Emirates which I flew with recently, however there were not enough toilets. The staff were excellent and the food was good. The vegetarian options were far better than Emirates. The red wine served in economy was surprisingly good. The seat was comfortable for economy and the leg room was better than I had expected. The entertainment was excellent with a good touch screen with a great range of options including kids movies, new release, classic movies and TV shows. On our connecting flight we flew on an A330 which seemed older and the screen was not touch screen but the options were identical.",Promoter

Nice and new aircraft with warm ambience inside the cabin, the light is soft and not too bright so during serving meal you can continue to sleep if you don't want to eat. There are 2-3 meals option so you choose, the meal taste is good. The space between the seat is wide enough, so you have more legroom. Stewardess is also very helpful, full attention, and friendly to the children, they gave my children toy so they can play during long haul flight. The amenities is almost complete they gave toothbrush, toothpaste, blindfold,earmuffs, and sock in nice wallet. I'm very satisfied with the service.",Promoter
"  Economy class flight from Heathrow to Doha was good. The seats were comfortable and spacious. The service was good, the aircraft and in particular the toilets were clean. The cabin crew were pleasant and helpful. However there was a complete contrast to the flight from Doha to Kuala Lumpur. The seats were narrow, and crammed. The service was poor and the aircraft looked that it could do with an update. The toilets were dirty and cabin crew unfriendly and did the bare minimum.",Detractor
"  Doha to Bangkok. Taking the opportunity of some promotion (2 for one), we indulged ourselves by flying business class of Qatar Airways between Doha and Bangkok on their A380 and we had an amazing experience. The magic starts at Doha Airport business lounge which is certainly one of a kind for its design and the level of service. The experience continues onboard with the business seats that offer extreme confort and privacy, and a wide choice of entertainment opportunities. The food was simply top notch with great wine selection. To stretch your legs you have the bar which offers a comfortable and relaxing setting. Great and attentive service on top of this. What more can you ask?",Promoter
"  Kuwait to New York via Doha. Kuwait to Doha was in economy class. I am a Platinum Privilege Club member with well over 2000 Points - which means I fly on Qatar a lot, usually at least 20-30 sectors a year, sometimes more. I had only flown on Economy once before as the other time I had an economy seat they upgraded me. All in all, not bad for a short hop. I was, however, irked just after take off when I asked for a beer and was refused, on the apparent basis that they did not serve alcohol on local Middle East flights. I know that upfront I would have been sipping Champagne by then. Being Ramadan (although a night flight and we were traveling when Ramadan restrictions are lifted), that may have been a problem too, but a colleague at work had the same problem a month or two before when flying to Australia and it was not Ramadan, and refused to fly himself or his family on Qatar again because of that. However, one of the hostesses was extremely good and saved the day by going up front and bringing me back a large paper coffee cup with a decent quantity of beer in it - which I appreciated because I did not want to be insensitive to those around me since in economy anyway and it was Ramadan so fine to have it in a paper cup for all involved - including me, as Qatar ought to be sensitive to my wants too as I am also a paying customer. Although the cabin was modern and clean and the staff brilliant I felt sorry for anyone who would have to fly in such cramped seats internationally. Qatar now have 10 across on the 777, instead of 9. Things improved dramatically when I got to Doha and travelled onto New York. The new A350 is an absolutely beautiful plane to fly on. For business class, much better than the A380, despite no bar. It is more intimate, service is much better (the hosts on the A380 being overstretched with so many to serve) and the plane is so silent and smooth with good air quality you really notice. Brilliant hard product on this plane, brilliant service, quite good food (although Qatar has gone a little down-hill the last 2/3 years on that front - I remember the Beluga Caviar starters I used to get back then), great in flight entertainment, and a good nights sleep after my bed was made up. Their business product puts most others to shame, although I hope they aim back at trying to make it a business class product as good as first again. Flight home from New York was pretty much a mirror image, although the food was really not up to par with what I am used to on Qatar.",Promoter
  Mumbai to Boston via Doha. Flying with Qatar Airways was the best experience ever. The cabin crew were remarkable and all the entertainment is excellent.

"  Bangkok to Warsaw via Doha. Qatar Airways keeps standard at the highest level. The seat arrangement is most comfortable among all business classes (1+2+1 for the aircraft I flew) and service reminds of a high class restaurant due to small but important details. Serving drinks in dedicated glassware instead of one uniform glass, food served on china plates instead of plastic trays, engaged and helpful staff, high quality cosmetics (maybe except of Armani sets handed out previously). The bar in A380 helps to relax and and socialize with fellow passengers. Cons: only a few business lounges so outside of Qatar it's difficult to have true Qatar Airways experience before taking off. Taking alcohol off view during Ramadan shouldn't be the case in the international air territory in a plane full of all the races.",Promoter
"  Madrid to Singapore via Doha in economy class. Crews professional but robotic. Seats, on-board entertainment and meals are all fine. Wifi expensive and limited. Leased A350 from LATAM on MAD-DOH sector was a step down from Qatar Airways own A350 product and first time that I've been so hot on a flight. Ticket prices and schedules are often competitive, at least for the two ultra-last-minute trips I've purchased this summer. You get what you pay for perhaps, which is just fine, but I don't understand the 5-star hype.",Passive
  Los Angeles to Bangkok via Doha. This is the first time my husband and I fly with Qatar Airways and we love it - and won't be the last time. My husband is from England and I'm from Thailand. We fly very often out of the country. It was our honeymoon and the flight attendants starting with the ground lady in LA at the counter when we checked in and the crew members treated us so special. They have done a wonderful job. A big thank to all the crew members for making us feel so special with the cake & heart decoration before we landed and during the flight we got pampered. We would fly with Qatar again. Business class is surely such a treat! Keep up the excellent work! We will post the pictures on our social media.

"  I flew on Qatar Airways from Auckland to Heathrow return (via Doha), firstly on the Boeing 787 to Doha then on the A380 to Heathrow. This is the best airline I have flown, and I have travelled the world on many occasions. I was a bit sceptical on the Auckland to Doha journey (this being the longest flight in the world) but I need not have worried, as the time passed quickly thanks to the excellent cabin crew, regularity of good quality meals and beverages and the generous amount of leg room. I was lucky enough to be seated upstairs in Economy on the A380 to Heathrow. My return journey was just as good and I was again lucky enough to have 3 seats to myself on both the Heathrow to Doha flight and Doha to Auckland. Overall Qatar would be the top my list of airlines to fly again with and is definitely value for money.",Promoter
"  First time on Qatar Airways from London to Bali via Doha and won't be the last - they are streets ahead with their business product over Emirates and Etihad. The lounge in LHR was top notch with an amazing a la carte service. Onboard the staff were super friendly and attentive with a high class of food. The bar at the back of the plane is great and service again exemplary. The seat was really comfortable - no complaints. On the second leg to DPS on the A330 I was expecting to be disappointed having just been on the A380. I was wrong, the service was even better. Massive smiles, nothing too much trouble, even profuse apologies for the selected red wine being too cold - now that's service. The whole outbound service blew me away. The one niggle is that the Oryx entertainment system lacks in the latest releases - now I feel I am being picky.",Promoter
"  Melbourne to Athens via Doha. The cabin crew created a restful and friendly atmosphere. A number of children who were restless and tired while boarding quickly settled down when they received their activity packs. I found that the time of the first long leg passed quickly thanks to ambient lighting, attentive service and an entertainment system which worked without any problems. From Doha to Athens the flight attendant allocated to our seat was particularly helpful, responding courteously to special requests about meals and drinks. On both legs the plane was full but remained clean and orderly throughout. Passengers seemed aware of the need to make some variations to the flight path. As I had a window seat I got to see a most impressive snow capped mountain peak below. The minimal amount of time added was amply compensated for by the efficient way the flight crew managed boarding, disembarkation, take off and landing.",Promoter
"  Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha. Bangkok ground staff are polite, but during boarding, it was the most chaotic scene. The Boeing 777-300 uses the 3-4-3 configuration. On this flight, the flight attendant serving my section was sub par of what I'm used to at Qatar airways. The food was fantastic. The flight to Frankfurt was on a brand new A350, with wide seats a the tail camera. I really like the exterior cameras! The flight attendant who was friends with another flight attendant I met before, and was polite and very friendly. On the return leg from Vienna, 4 counters open with few passengers. This time, the cabin was only 40% full, so I moved rows and had a whole row to myself. The catering from European airports is always good, so my braised beef with potato au gratin was excellent. The flight attendant I met remembered what I wanted and made the service so personalised it was like a first class flight in economy! She is the best flight attendant I've ever met! In the rear galley, I also met a Bhutanese and Moroccan flight attendant who were equally as nice. But the nicest of them all has to be the Cabin Services Director who came to my seat just before landing to say hello, and we exchanged pleasantries. During disembarkation, I asked if I was able to get a photo with the captain. While waiting for the captain to come out of the cockpit, I was able to try out the business class seat and found it superior to Cathay Pacific's product. On the return leg, wifi wasn't working for much of the flight. Overall, it was totally a 10/10 flight, with the minor complaints about the experience at Bangkok airport.",Promoter
"  Another excellent flight with Qatar Airways in Business Class. I flew Birmingham to Bangkok via Doha on the 787 Dreamliner first leg then A380 second leg. The 787 business cabin in excellent with plenty of space. The seats are 1-2-1 lie flat pod style all with aisle access. The service is always excellent, the staff are so well trained and always friendly, unlike Emirates. I had an amazing 4 course meal on the first leg, soup, fish, cheese cake and cheese board with 30 year tawny port. I watched 3 new movies on the 7 hour flight before arrival in Doha. I slept the entire second leg on the A380 as it was an overnight flight. The seats are the same but this aircraft has the inflight bar. I've had many good times in this bar but I didn't use it this time. I agree with other reviewers that Qatar offers the best business class, mainly due to the excellent staff. Emirates should send a mystery shopper to see how it should be done.",Promoter
"  Another excellent flight with Qatar Airways in Business class. I flew Phuket to Birmingham via Doha on Boeing 777 first leg then Boeing 787 second leg. The first leg had an aircraft change from Boeing 787 to Boeing 777 which was good as the Boeing 777 business cabin in so spacious. You get a metre of leg room, enough room to stand up. The seats are 2-2-2 so we took 2 near the window. They're very big and comfortable and lie-flat. The service was excellent as usual, I had a lovely 4 course meal, soup, sea bass, chocolate cake & cheese board with 30 year tawny port. The movie choice is not so good, I couldn't find anything new to watch as I'd watched the 3 best movies on the outbound flight from BHX. We had 3 hours between flights in Doha, the lounge was virtually empty and they're weren't serving alcohol due to Ramadan to the dismay of several western travelers. I slept the entire second leg on the 787 but I've already reviewed that in a previous post. Congratulations Qatar, keep up the good work.",Promoter
"  Doha to Cape Town. This is my tenth year flying with Qatar Airways, mostly to and from South Africa and the Middle East. This particular trip was truly remarkable. Everything was overwhelming, but the crew and especially the purser on this flight deserve special mention, what an extraordinary level of anticipation of every possible wish. On boarding I mentioned that I would prefer a window seat, the purser went and asked every single passenger seated by a window if they would swap with me. The food was outstanding too, the seat on the B787 comfortable enough to sleep for almost the entire flight. Qatar Airways is unique, in a class of its own.",Promoter
  Flew Qatar Airways from Bangkok to Copenhagen via Doha. Standards even higher than before. Did in total 6 premium flights and 2 economy. All flights top notch service and excellent crew.

"  Copenhagen to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha on 15-16 June 2017 on B787 and A330 respectively. Flights were on time and service was good. Doha airport deserted due to the ongoing blockage and due to Ramadan. QR tackles the crises well by preponing some of the connecting flights from Doha to avoid delays due to excessive lengths of routings avoiding unfriendly airspace. Check-in and crew onboard are diligent and almost faultless. Food, despite 3 choices offered, was not so good and continues to be of poorer and poorer quality and amounts. Completely inedible plastic sandwiches provided ""in lieu"" of proper meal to escape a second hot meal service. Poor wines. Alcoholic drinks were available but not disclosed due to Ramadan. We travelled two persons and were given 3-4 adjacent seats on both flights thus amble space. Elite fliers well respected and cared for. Lounge access working but the denial of access to Al Mourjan lounge in Doha hits hard: their elite flier lounges are not up to the game. Onboard, lengthy safety video shown with Barcelona FC become boring after being unchanged for several years. I am puzzled by the intrusive charity propaganda and money collection attempt by introducing ""Educate a Child"" propaganda without providing any facts and prove of efficiency. Children well cared for and given gifts and child meal given if requested prior to travel. Luggage handled well and all 4 pieces arrived to perfection at final destination.",Promoter
"  Doha to Amsterdam. This aircraft is the one with the 24 seat business class cabin in a 2X2X2 seat format across. Older aircraft and seat width is not as wide as on the new A380 and A350 at around 20.5 inches for upper part and smaller at the lower section. Fully flat seat but the lower half of the seat has been forced down further from people sitting or putting weight on what is not a very sturdy part of the seat so the seat needed to be raised a little to get it into a comfortable flat bed. However, service was excellent, four crew for 24 passengers with eat when you want from the menu. Breakfast on offer out of Doha and light snacks and meals available then or later with wine etc. before arriving in Amsterdam. Tasty food, nicely presented.",Promoter
"  May 12, flew ORD-DOH-DEL on QR 726/QR578 in Business Class. Qatar has never been anything but amazing and this trip was the best so far. Check-in agents were really fun and nice and checked the bag to Delhi. The only let-down of the entire trip was the lounge Qatar uses at O'Hare. The Air France/KLM lounge is shared by about 13 airlines so it is packed! This lounge should not allow more than a couple airlines to use it - nice food spread but too crowded and bad wifi. Wish Qatar shared the BA lounge here. Anyways we boarded on-time and the service started immediately. The friendly attendant came and introduced herself to my friend and me, handed out pyjamas and talked about the amenity kit that was already at our seats along with slippers and the blanket/duvet for sleeping. The purser then came to introduce herself and drinks were delivered after with a smile. Menus handed out and as Qatar does dine-on-demand you can eat anytime. It's much easier for the attendants as they don't have to serve everyone at once, but I can see how it can be arduous at times. Pushed back a bit late and a greeting from the flight deck for the 13.30 hour flight to Doha. Chose to eat dinner and watch movies - their AVOD is very good but not as good as Emirates. But their service kicks Emirates a million times over. So after dinner made up my bed and slept 6 hours but the flight was quite turbulent. Woke and washed up in the bathroom and my meal was ready for me - timed well from the excellent attendant. The only thing they could enhance is offering wifi on their 777-300 planes. That is where they are not as competitive as Emirates or Etihad. Landed 20 min late into Doha and a smooth transfer into the Al-Mourjan Business class lounge for some food and a nice shower. 2 hour connection was timed perfect and boarded our 787 for the 3 1/2 hour flight to Delhi. The 787 is much newer but my friend and I both preferred the 777-300ER biz seats. But still a great service and watched some Breaking Bad until a 2am ontime arrive into Delhi. Immigration was busy but got the bags and out to the taxi in 45 minutes. Qatar pushes things to a new level- even when flying them in coach it's pleasant. But their Business Class is the best of any airline in my opinion.",Promoter

Her lay over in Doha was overnight for about 12 hours or more and the last time they said the only hotel available inside the airport was full. This time we got the transit visa which was applied for on the website and was quickly processed and arrived before the 7 day published on the site. On arrival in Doha, Qatar Airways arranged for her transportation and escorted her to a nearby 4 star hotel, provided wifi, a dinner voucher, woke her up the next morning in time to get dressed, have breakfast and picked her up promptly for her onward journey. Hotel stay, food, and transportation for that night may have amounted to just about $125 which is a tiny fraction of her ticket cost but I am so impressed and grateful for the peace of mind l had that she was well taken care of. I will advocate for this airline any day.",Promoter
"  Sydney to Doha. Business class was full but crew were very efficient, excellent service. Seats were comfortable and large touch screen tv for entertainment system.

Qatar also allow you to stagger your dining, setting times for when you would like dishes served which means they will reserve one of these dishes for you. Food presentation and range of dishes are more premium economy but they are very tasty. Fully flat bed is comfortable, not as wide as on Singapore but they are comfortable in flat bed.",Promoter

Flight left Dubai 15 minutes early, unusually in my experience berthing at an airbridge on arrival Doha thus no requirement to join the hordes fighting through security. One of Qatar's ageing Airbus 330s for the flight to Chongqing so no Wifi or power at seat, but perfectly clean and seat comfortable enough for a few hours sleep.

"  Istanbul to Cape Town via Doha. First leg was full on an A330 from Istanbul to Doha. First thing that was obvious was that this was an old plane. The seats looked like they had seen better days and the in flight screens were not touched and had to be controlled by hand held devices in the arm rest. On top of this, many screens were not working and people requested to have a reset. The crew were polite and the cabin senior from Bangladesh was the most outstanding crew member I have had in a while. He was older, wiser and had a knack for making me feel at home given the old plane and a poor inflight entertainment options. The meals were ok but the plastic containers look cheap and tacky and serving tea in paper cups seems like the cheap way out. The flight was on time and we arrived at gate before scheduled arrival. The onward leg to Cape Town was in the Boeing 787. I get the impression that at Hamad all flights from Doha to the developing world have to be subjected to the c20-27 gates which means being bused to a remote standing aircraft. I have experienced this before at Hamad. For elderly passengers this remote stand departures are a severe inconvenience. Boeing 787 seemed new, the inflight entertainment worked a charm and the cabin crew on this flight were wonderful. The meals were again just ok but I slept and thus just picked on the food.

On bord, it's not only the sophisticated seat (787), the low number of seats per toilet, the meal on demand-service or food and drinks (they serve Guinness!) that are special.

Both journeys on A380 truly fantastic - attentive staff, great food and drinks and total comfort. B777 from DOH to BLR was very good but not the same as A380.

But I have had problems with the in-flight entertainment system, which is difficult to operate and often has faults though not broken. The food is average at best. Meals are very small and the light meal / snack is always the same: a hot baked thing (sweet or savoury option) which they call a sandwich but is something different, with a small, poor cake. The chicken sandwiches are quite unpleasant and difficult to eat, but when you're hungry and there is no alternative offered, what can you do?",Passive

Was quoted a price at the ticket counter which seemed reasonable, however was asked to call the online sales team to make the changes and advised the price had increased by over a third. There was nothing the online sales team could apparently do so I didn't upgrade. Complained to Qatar and had to chase responses from them repeatedly after lengthy delays,and a waste of my time.

"  London to Khartoum via Doha on Qatar Airways. My flight from LHR to Doha was on a A350 and its a great plane with very comfortable economy seating and leg room even though I am a large chap, the crew done their job perfectly well and no issues on this flight. I had a 2hr layover at Hamad International and it is a great airport and the transfer was smooth and efficient. The flight to Khartoum was on a A320 from a remote stand so a bus journey to the plane ensure and the seats on this was somewhat smaller and although not entirely uncomfortable was a bit squeezed in. The food served was 2 pastries, one sweet and one savoury which felt a bit weird. Landing at what is probably one of the worst airports in Africa was smooth and no issues with luggage. The return flight a week later, the plane was delayed for 2hrs with no a information from Qatar Airways or airport staff and Qatar ground staff did finally appear when boarding was announced they blamed the delay on no gates being available at the airport, no apologies or anything. I found the plane not very clean, rather old and had no IFE apart from overhead screens. No delay apology was made by the Captain and the food served was spicy lamb meatballs with dill rice which was a bit of a weird meal for what was supposed to be a 2am departure and on arrival at Doha we was once again at a remote stand and bussed to the terminal where I had a 1 1/2hr transit. The flight to London was on a A380 and the seating was very comfortable and the service from the crew was good although the food was terrible. - some sort of scrambled egg, dry frankfurter and some sauteed mushrooms and the snack served prior to landing was chicken in some sort of flat bread wrap that was bland. It seems that the service on routes like to/from Khartoum leaves a lot to be desired as does the fact that they still use remote stands and the food in general was a let down.",Passive

Outstanding service by the flight crew and food as usual. Used the Le Meridien airport hotel for an overnight stay at each end and very satisfied with it. The only major issue with Cairo airport is the lack of transport between terminals - always an adventure. Went through about half a dozen security check points throughout the airport - most I've ever experienced. Everyone at the airport willing to help and friendly. Departed Cairo a bit late even though the airport was pretty ""dead"". Return trip was on an A330-300. Not a good experience compared to the other Qatar Airways aircraft I've flown on (A320, A321, A350, 787, 380). Very cramped and no storage space. Will not use their A330 service again. Once again the flight crew and meals were great but not the aircraft. Qatar continues to excel in all areas and it's always a pleasure flying with them.",Promoter

First sector from Muscat to Doha on an A320 an Economy full flight and Doha to Thiruvananthapuram (A321) surprisingly upgraded to Business Class. I had been traveling with Qatar Airways in Business Class, even the Economy class short sector flight (MCT-DOH) was a pleasant experience too. The second leg of my travel from DOH-TRV, Qatar Airways surprised me at the Boarding Gate with a Business Class upgrade and the inflight experience was a treat of Five Star.

"  One way between Cape Town to London Heathrow via Doha with Qatar Airways. I travelled with Virgin Atlantic out to South Africa so was interested to see how they match up. Check in at CPT was quick but not much other interaction from the agent security was fairly quick, Qatar use the Bidvest lounge which was okay with food and drink on offer enough seating too. Boarding was a little slow I think due to the late arrival of the the aircraft but once on board the crew where responsive polite offering drinks amenity kits and menus. Flight departed around 30 minutes late I was in seat 2A which was very comfortable once airborne meal orders taken drinks offered and an apology for the late departure from the crew manager. Food was pretty good as was the service, I managed some decent sleep during the 9hrs 20min flight the entertainment system was okay but not very responsive. Arrival in Doha on time to a remote stand business class passengers bussed separately to the terminal, I used the Qatar lounge which is very good although huge it feels fine. Boarding from A3 on to the LHR flight was organised I had seat 22A on this flight which I like at the rear of business cabin. Again crew very responsive offering PJs night kits drinks etc. Departed on time although I skipped food and opted for breakfast 2 hours before arrival. I slept for 4 hours of this night flight woke by the crew to a pretty good breakfast about 2 hours out of LHR. Flight arrived almost 1 hour early which was nice bags off quickly I was home within an hour of landing. Great service I prefer the A380 to other Qatar aircraft although not used A350 yet.

The return flight from CCJ to DOH did not have a flight entertainment system and I did not get the food i had requested for. The staff are amazing. On my return I tweeted to Qatar Airways regarding the issues I faced and they were quick to respond to my query and assist.

Hence a quick busy shuttle flight which landed on time and all was good and efficient. After reaching Doha moved to Departure Hall. Hamad airport is dark and not properly lighten up. Our onward flight to Amritsar was from gate C24 which is on the ground level. The place looks does not provide good travel experience.

Refreshing towel pack handed out but no menus were given. Drinks are served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served is not up to 5 star mark and average. It took a long time for flight attendant to serve the meal and to take away trays after finishing the meal. The flight departs at 02:20 am and reaches by 08:15 am. It would be better and appropriate if they serve breakfast on this sector rather than serving dinner. There was a long queue for going to washroom after the meal.

This last flight was on seat 2A (Dammam-Doha, A330-200) and 2K (Doha-Manila-Doha, B777-300ER) and 2A (Doha-Dammam, A320). Cabin crew make extra efforts to provide passenger's needs anytime. Food options are very good. One note however, I still prefer the Armani amenity kit of the past rather than the latest one.

"  Madrid to Manila via Doha. Our inbound Iberia flight was delayed. It was a race against time. Upon deplaning, to the luggage belt and me up to the check in counter for our flight to Doha on Qatar Airways. When I got to the Business Class check-in counter, I was told that the check in was closed and she will have to see if her supervisor would allow us. At that point, my partner was still getting our bags out. I had to beg. It was such a low point that I had no choice but to do it. The check in staff told me to inform my partner to leave the bags behind, so i sent him a text. He arrived a few moments later. After checking in two bags and missing one, my partner gave the QR check in staff all the Iberia luggage tags for them to arrange whatever they could to send the missing bag to Manila. She asked for my email and she then promised to communicate via email. She escorted us to security clearance. Then after the checks, we ran, took the train to get to Terminal 4s. Upon reaching the terminal, we had to clear immigration, showed the staff the fast track, got cleared and we ran to Gate R-18. Gasping for air, we reached the gate. Boarding was about to finish. We made it in the nick of time. Sweltering in our sweat, the boarding staff informed us that two of our bags made it as well. When I try to look back, I gave ourselves allowance of almost three hours for our flight to Manila. Should Iberia did not bump us off, all should've gone smoothly as planned. I don't know what the purpose of OneWorld now is. It promises smooth travels with its partner Airlines. What for is the frequent flyer status when one is placed in situations such as this. I tell you, no monetary amount could compensate the distress that my partner and I had to undergo due to Iberia's shortcoming. When we got to Manila, Qatar Airways Ground Services was holding a placard with our names on it. We approached him and he told us that the QR agent in Madrid sent them an email regarding our missing luggage and that they would do their best to locate it and have it delivered to us. I hope I would get to hear from them soon and I hope OneWorld gets to do something about this. On the other hand, I would always commend Qatar Airways for their efficiency and for its impeccable service. They have always been reliable. To the QR check in staff who assisted us, I was not able to get your name at that time but I would always be thankful for making it possible for us to get on our flight.

Good catering and pre-departure drinks, but the flight is so short that there is no food provided and no food is available except some sweet cookies and nuts. FAs were kind and gave me extraordinarily a free amenity kit as I inquired for - but these are normally not given on short flights. Flight was early and arrived 20 Minutes ahead of schedule.

When I purchased the tickets, I made sure seat assignments were reserved and confirmed. Unfortunately, when we get to the check in counter, we were assigned different seats on our DOH-MAD leg. I find it exasperating as my partner and I were traveling together yet we were situated in seats far from each other. What's the point of pre-selecting seats? Past the immigration clearance and security checks, we headed to the lounge. Lounge was pretty basic. A meagre selection of snacks and refreshments. Air-conditioning was way too cold. Whiled away the time at the waiting area. Boarding came, there was no system in place. Boarding queue was chaotic. Premium passengers were overtaken by coach passengers. Anyhow, in-flight service was superb. The cabin crew took heed of my specific requests. It was great as it was dining-on demand. Meal service was spotless.

Very comfortable flight all around and was able to use my cpap machine for sleep apnoea in flight with no issues which was why I chose the Qatar option in first place (787s all the way). Only criticism would be the IFE touch screen was very sluggish and the children's meals were drab plus no play packs for kids. On arrival at Doha had long walk carrying kids. Then found the Boeing 787 to Cape Town changed at last minute to Boeing 777-300. There was an air of frantic rush here as we were herded on plane when we should have departed. The seats were so unfortunately and no power for my medical equipment. Unlike previous flight staff did not know of my medical request and so I had a horrendous flight with no sleep.

"  Barcelona to Bangkok return via Doha. Economic reality dictates these days that my QR flying has now to be in Economy, not Biz. Both BCN sectors were in A330, which, though a little dated are a perfectly acceptable plane for a 6 hr flight. Still nice to have the 2-4-2 layout that enables a couple travelling to be able to sit by themselves. Doha to BKK was in an A380, which is a wonderful plane. The little Economy sector on the upper deck is as good as it gets in Economy, in my opinion, with great seats, and plenty of space, but from what I saw, the lower deck is almost as good. Which is why I was so disappointed when I found out that the Bangkok to Doha section was changed to a B777 300. What a come-down, QR felt fit to follow the trend of 3-4-3 in Economy, instead of the 3-3-3 . This cabin is seriously cramped. It was impossible to pass in the aisle if there was a large person or trolley in it, and no elbow room to eat etc in any seat. These people need to get the message that they cannot go squeezing yet more seats into already overcrowded jets to make a fast buck. Cannot speak for other carriers, but the difference on QR between their A380 offering and the 773 offering is embarrassing.",Passive

"  London to Denpasar Bali via Doha, returning Jakarta to London via Doha. Outbound on A330 and inbound on the Boeing 787. After a horrendous journey through London to get to Heathrow, I was escorted to the front of the check-in queue and allowed to use Business Class check-in to make the 1 hour cutoff for my flight. Overnight flight from London to Doha was on time and unremarkable other than for some bizarre reason the main cabin lights were not switched off during the flight. Fortunately Qatar's economy amenities kit is good and features an eyemask, which was needed on this occasion. Legroom in seat 20K was poor due to the IFE box under the seat in front. Food was good and cabin crew were very polite. Hot towels served on boarding and in the morning which is a nice touch. The really good Qatar service came on transfer in Doha. After freshening up I made my way to the boarding gate for the Doha-Bali leg, to find an incredibly long queue for what was clearly a full flight. At the boarding gate, the agent switched my boarding pass and only after passing through the gate did I realise he had upgraded me to business class! The onboard business class service was impeccable. The seats were clean, had multiple recline positions and plenty of room to store belongings you wanted access to in-flight. There was a good pre-flight drinks service (including champagne), the amenities kit was excellent (featuring Armani products) and the cabin crew were the most polite and attentive I've ever encountered. Throughout the flight there was an on-demand meal service, superb wine list (including a Sauternes dessert wine) and the bathrooms were cleaned by a member of cabin staff after every use by a passenger. Absolutely faultless service. What's more, I did not feel that the staff treated me any differently just because I had the fortune to have been upgraded for free instead of having paid full price for the experience. Return flights in economy were very good and better than the outbound LHR-DOH leg: this had a lot to do with the Boeing 787 plane, which had far better lighting and more spacious seats, which made sleeping far easier. I had a window seat and appreciate the tinted window function on the Dreamliner. Again, cabin crew were excellent and the food was very good for economy class. IFE options were very good. Ground staff and gate agents on transfer in Doha some of the politest I've ever encountered. Overall, very impressed with the service that Qatar offers, and would certainly consider using them again flying to Asian destinations if the price is competitive with (e.g.) Singapore Airlines.",Promoter

My pillow went below my bottom instead of my head the seat was so uncomfortable. The flights from Doha to Bangkok had particularly bad food, no middle eastern food was offered which I found strange. My chicken and potatoes with vegetables reminded me of a discount meal. The lounge had good food and a nice shower, but had a smoking room coupled with poor ventilation.

"  Check in at Athens Airport was very fast and easy. The A330 we flew on towards Doha was a nice aircraft, decent, spacious seats, good inflight entertainment and also was half full which allowed for empty seats next to me which is always great. The cabin crew were professional, polite and efficient. Inflight food was also of good quality with two options available. We arrived on time in Doha and all was good. Doha to Dubai we flew with the new A350. Unfortunatelly it was a LATAM A350 which Qatar leased off them which was not as good as Qatar own ones but still for a 1hr flight its fine. All in all a very good journey.",Promoter
"  Flew back home with Qatar. Flight from Dubai to Doha was done on the A330. A quick busy flight which landed on time and all was good and efficient. Flight from Doha to Athens was done on Qatar's small A320 however it waas a very comfortable plane with spacious seats, inflight entertainment and the best thing is that it was almost empty which allowed empty seats next to passengers. The staff were extremely helpful (even approached me as a frequent flyer and greeted me). Food and beverages good as well. Cant fault it.",Promoter
"  Doha to Munich. As a solo traveller I hate their 2-2-2 configuration in the Boeing 777, which they fly from Amsterdam. To avoid this I use Belgium, Germany or even Skandinavian as starting point for my trip, since Qatar Airways uses the 787 or new A350 to Doha. I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that Qatar Airways uses a leased A350 from LATAM on their Doha-Munich route. The config in business class in this plane is 2-2-2 and more cramped than the 777. Toilets were messy, service below par and sitting near the window means climbing over your fellow passenger. This was the second plane change for the worse in 5 months.",Detractor
"  Kuala Lumpur to London via Doha. A pleasant overnighter, departing Kuala Lumpur at 02:00, on which I got more than six hours sleep on the Boeing 787. I love this aircraft's cabin air quality. The seat is great and the 1-2-1 Business cabin is cosier than Qatar's A350 or 380. It left right on time. The Doha to London sector was a 777 with an older 2-2-2 layout and product, which my partner and I are usually quite happy with. But it does look and feel dated, compared with the latest Qatar Airways Business product. My seat seemed to dangle at the end, so didn't go completely flat. Still, this aircraft type will shortly be retrofitted with Qatar's latest Q Suite. Catering was good, in that as an alternative to the main breakfast offering, there were also several delicious alternatives. Cabin crew were excellent. The only issue was the frustrating 30 minutes holding before landing at Heathrow. But we still made it to the gate on time.",Promoter
"  My last flight from Doha to New York JFK was disappointing. Upon boarding, a couple in Business Class insisted to have their child, booked in Economy, upgraded and made a scene when it could not be arranged. In the process, several passengers were asked to change seats, some accepting and some not. The FAs stood by. The old Business Class seats in Boeing 777s are well below those found elsewhere. The food and amenity kits have been very downgraded. The winesremain very good. If you happen to like dark chocolate, you are not in luck. The boxes of four have been replaced by single milk pieces. The robot-like unsmiling service (with the exception of the perfectly charming Flight Service Director who acknowledged the facts and wrote her own report) was performed with no grace. Call buttons had to be pressed several times to be acknowledged. My IFE handset was unreliable, touch screen on the main video is too far to be easily accessed. In Doha, I found food availability and service in the Business Class lounge badly reduced. None of this is tragic and I very much realize the ""Let them eat cake"" aspect of such criticism.",Passive
"  Brussels to Singapore via Doha. Efficient check in at Bru airport, no priority security clearance for Qatar passengers. Qatar uses the BA lounge, which is rather basic. Boarding fast and organized. Seat on both flights identical, the great herringbone seats. Very comfy with lots of storage space. Service impeccable, food ex Brussels very average, slightly better ex Doha. Doha lounge massive, with good drinks, but average food. The place lacks soul. I had the chance to compare the B787 and A350 here, and the 350 wins with flying colors. Much quieter than the Boeing 787, the air is significantly less dry, the window shields more sophisticated, and even the toilet flush worked better. It feels more spacious and elegant than the 787. Overall good flights with average food.",Promoter
"  Kuala Lumpur to Copenhagen via Doha in March 2017. The ticket was the return travel on an extremely cheap economy ticket purchased for less than 500 USD several months prior to travel. Despite the ticket is in O-class, and thus not upgradable, they sent me an offer 2 weeks before to pay 400 USD extra for the last sector to CPH. I could not resist as this also gave me access to Al Mourjan Lounge in Doha, where I spent 15 hours, which I don't mind. First sector: in Kuala Lumpur I tried all 3 lounges offered (Plaza Premium, Golden Business, and First Class). All were good. As the flight was only 30-40% full and as I am elite flyer they gave me 4 seats on the A340-600 to stretch out. In economy I was pampered throughout. Special meal accommodated and other meals offered. Drink rounds very, very frequent and staff super alert. IFE fine. At arrival in Doha only bus transport available to Terminal. Second flight on a Boeing 787-8, flight on time. Contact-gate in Doha. That makes things much easier and allowed for leaving the lounge late as the walk took only 5 Minutes from lounge to aircraft. Good service onboard, despite business class was full. Good food, excellent wines, poor beers. It annoys me that they request charity support from passengers for the â€œEducate a Childâ€ charity. They want people to put money in envelopes onboard! I find this extremely intrusive and disrespectful to passengers.",Promoter
"  Smooth flight experiences on both ways from Zurich to Doha with Qatar Airways. Excellent business class layout and seats. Superb food and wine list. Only negative was that the screens on my seats were not touch screens and the navigation with the handset was a little difficult, because the touch screen there was to small for my fingers.",Promoter
"  Doha to Colombo return. The A340 seat layout is 2-2-2 style similar to Lufthansa. Seat comfortable, only minus is the rather narrow space for your feet. If you can, choose the front row, where the foot space is bigger. The IFE screens are big and as touch screens very responsive, excellent. Amenity kit on the flights to and from Colombo are more basic than on other international flights, but it is only a 4h 30min flight. Flight from Doha left 50 minutes late due to a medical emergency on board before take off. Return flight uneventful with on time departure and early arrival.",Passive
  Colombo to London via Doha. The sector from Doha to London was flawless on an A380-800. The flight took off and arrived on time. In-flight services were very good. The seating was 3x4x3 and there were plenty of toilets. The flight attendants were attentive without being overwhelming. Altogether a good flight. The Colombo to Doha sector on an A340 with 2x4x2 seat configuration had a few problems. Although I had checked in online I had to join the queue to drop my bag off. I could not see the point of checking-in online. The check-in/bag drop girl spoke in phrases and not in sentences. Boarding was rather chaotic but I presume that this is mostly to do with the airport staff at Colombo. The flight departed 1 hour and 10 minutes late after boarding and because of a thunderstorm. CMB-DOH sector not good but DOH-LHR sector was very good.,Passive
"  Hong Kong to Madrid via Doha. Nice flight, very nice check in, very nice flight attendant especially on the flight Doha to Madrid. The flight was late and they advised on air to the airport that we would be late. Chief of cabin talked Portuguese, made us feel confortable with the delay, the Boeing 787 is a fantastic plane lots of seat space and does not seem to end the trip so tired. The inflight entertainment stills has a way to go against the competitors",Promoter
"  Nice boarding in Madrid, very nice flight but flight attendent seems to be flying for the first time. My wife asked for a Low Fat Meal, we had to tell her both times that we had that meal, because somehow she seems to forget, nevertheless she had the seat number on the tray. This was on the Madrid to Doha Flight, the flight to Hong Kong was regular but I like the IFE better on Emirates, better tech on the Qatar but less choice.",Promoter
"  Bangkok to Frankfurt via Doha. Before my flight, I have spoken to their Twitter. They respond within an hour, and if they don't, they apologise. During check in, it was chaotic and took me an hour. I understand since it's the big A380. The staff was nice, and answered all my questions. Apparently, the flight was overbooked. After tweeting this, Qatar airways was more than apologetic. Boarding was orderly, and a flight attendant greeted me at the door. When I got to my row, I met a Canadian flight attendant who started conversations with everyone and did this throughout the flight if she wasn't busy. She was very polite. Actually, all the flight attendants were polite and smiling. All of my flights left slightly late. The seat is comfortable however I had the last row so I had limited recline. Seats on the A380 and A350 are the same, and are very wide and comfortable. Legroom is sufficient for a 13 hour flight. One thing I would suggest they add would be a footrest. The TV screen is big, and touch screen responsive, rendering the remote useless. The food onboard was excellent. On the legs to and from Bangkok, The flight attendants saved a meal choice just for us. Try to choose the beef. Most of the time they have braised beef and potatoes, or spiced chicken. They are a bit sluggish, but still smile whenever they're interacting with passengers. I found the red wine to be low quality. I didn't like all of the audio selections, but at least they had 5 Celine Dion and 4 Michael Jackson albums, which kept me entertained. Movie selection is good. During deplaning, the flight attedant gave me a tour of the upper deck including the bar, business and first class. During transit in Doha, security check is much more organised than Taipei or Narita airport, but there a rude staff member at gate check who refused to let me board with my friend who was a Gold card member. On the return flight, I met a nice lady at check in who was having conversations with me and appreciated me trying to speak French. During flight, one Romanian attendant asked me to help translate, and she was very friendly and had conversations with me. On the flight to bangkok, there was a Malaysian flight attendant who was also very nice and talkative (I'm also talkative) so we had too much conversation, she wasn't able to service other passengers. Overall, an amazing experience unlike any other airline. I look forward to flying Qatar Airways business class in the future, when I save up!",Promoter
"  Doha to Riyadh. Excellent service, comfort, food and quality of aircraft. Shame it was only an hours flight. Were one of the first to board and were given hot towels and welcome drink. Air hostesses were very attentive and polite. Since this was an early morning flight were given breakfast which was of high quality. I recommend Qatar Airways.",Promoter
"  London Heathrow to Doha. Business Class in the A350 most the best compared to its competitors. The service from check in to the lounge up to the gate was excellent. Staff were very apologetic of the short delay from London and again due to missing out on the pre takeoff drink, which was offered to me after takeoff the air hostess apologised for the inconvenience. This aircraft has a 2 class configuration (Economy and Business) and they take customer service to the next level. Food was great and actually tasted great for airline food, especially the dessert. The full flatbed seats were in a 1x2x1 layout and were very comfortable.",Promoter
"  Doha to London Heathrow in December 2016. Best Economy class ever flown. Seats were comfortable and in flight entertainment was great. We were on row 50 as we had an infant with us, the leg room was good for economy and near to the rest rooms. Service and staff attitude was excellent. Breakfast was okay and probably on par with Emirates.",Promoter
  Riyadh to Doha. Nice experience and can say Qatar Airways lived up to its expectation as a 5 star airline. Food was good and we were given the seat preferences as per check in. Flight was a little delayed due to late passengers but did not affect me as the connecting flight was later.,Promoter
"  Tunis to Doha. The flight crew made me feel very welcome, so friendly and happy, and the flight manager was caring about the passenger one by one, she was smiling and offering to help with genuine smile and professional manner.

"  Frankfurt to Windhoek return via Doha. Economy from Frankfurt to Doha was in a new A350. The seats were acceptable, large screen, but the movie program was a disappointment. I found the food horrible. Crew was very nice. Arrival in Doha on time. The connecting flight was almost 3 hrs late due to late incomming aircraft. A Boeing 787, narrow seats, (entertainment box under some seats, plugs for headphones hidden in armrest). Same bad food for me, and very nice crew. Return flights were similar aircraft types with the same topics. I found the constant noise from the on/off signals for seat belts on a night flight quite annoying. After a few repetitions no one paid attention, since there were no turbulence to mention.",Passive

"  Travelled Qatar Airways from Copenhagen - Doha - Kuala Lumpur on 4th and 5th March 2017. Flights on time. Excellent trips and service top notch. It can hardly get better in economy. Staff caring, respectful, trying to pamper me at great lengths. Check-in cooperative and discussed opportunities for upgrade which I eventually could not as my ticket was extremely much discounted (purchased through global sale). Lounge used in CPH is the Aspire, which is rubbish but QR are now negotiating with the new Lounge â€œAdventureâ€ to change which could be a big boost. I was acknowledged as Platinum card holder on board and got extremely good attendance throughout. They prepared a special starter for me with rice-salad and cheese and wine. Drinks ad libitum, now only 1 white and 1 red wine available and no champagne. These 2 wines were â€“ to my taste â€“ extremely good. The white wine was South African produced from Pinot Gris grapes with an extremely rich taste. Were given 2 hot meals on both legs. They were all different, tasty, and good. The fact portions were small was outweighed by generous additions when requested. Flights not full and I could sleep stretched out on 3 seats on each leg. Flights only 500 USD (return ticket).",Promoter
